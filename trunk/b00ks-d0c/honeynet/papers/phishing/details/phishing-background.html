<p>This side note provides further detailed background on phishing attacks,
beginning with a historic overview of <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(computer_security)">social
	engineering</a>, and concluding with quantitative data on phishing attempts
and information on high level trends.</p>

<p>During the 1990&rsquo;s, as the popularity and take up of the Internet grew,
<a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(computer_security)">social
	engineering</a> was gradually transformed and attackers began to focus on the
mass consumer market. Phishers moved from <a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a>
to the unregulated and more anonymous Internet, with email becoming the
preferred medium for engaging (often na&iuml;ve) end users. One reason for this
change of focus might be that online discussion forums, IRC and instant
messaging were increasingly portrayed by the press as dangerous places, where
evildoers and system crackers waited to ambush unsuspecting users. Also, users
had become aware that legitimate companies nearly exclusively use telephone,
email and traditional postal mail as means of communication with their
customers, rarely participating in less formal chat sessions. Users had also
become more familiar with and confident in trusting web based authentication
systems, e-shopping with credit cards, online banking services and the
protection offered by technologies such as <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer
	(SSL)</a> - all fronted by a myriad of different looking user interfaces.</p>

<p>Internet based email solutions continued to evolve at a rapid rate, with
increasingly complex methods being offered to customise the look and feel of
email messages and therefore potentially fooling unsuspecting users into
trusting spoofed communications that might appear to be legitimate. When
compared to established and relatively well policed closed loop systems, it
still remains difficult for consumers to trace the exact origin of an SMTP mail
message, and the available global user base of Internet email is many times
larger. Even activities with a very low success rate can still be attractive to
an attacker if the number of end users receiving the message is large enough to
generate a number of responses, as can be witnessed by the continued growth in
organisations willing to pay for the sending of spam and many users' own
experiences of inboxes regularly full of unsolicited email.</p>

<p>In a more sinister turn, phishers have not only changed their primary means
of communication to email, they have also started operating in a more organised
manner and to target their attacks against more profitable information. In
recent years, requests for AOL accounts or single credit card numbers have
gradually been replaced with schemes aimed at obtaining more sensitive data,
such as personal information that could allow unlimited access to online banking
services or that could serve as a foundation to enable identity theft. Sensitive
information to fraudulently impersonate another person&rsquo;s identity might
include name, date of birth, address, social security number or
&quot;secret&quot; information such as mother's maiden name, account numbers,
first school, pet&rsquo;s name, user names, passwords, Personal Identification
Numbers (PINs) or even one-time passwords (which are quite common in European
Internet banking).</p>

<p>Phishing attacks have affected many users and have caused serious problems
for some major banks. In extreme cases, some banks have been forced to <a
	href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4019067.stm">shut down</a> their
ebanking operations for period of time due to phishing attacks. The exact cost
to the banking industry of phishing attacks is not available in the public
domain, and there are few well documented <a
	href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000129.html">qualitative
	examples</a> of public arrests and prosecution (such as in <a
	href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/04/estonian_trojan_suspect_cuffed/">Estonia</a>
or <a
	href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/21/brazil_phishing_arrest/">Brazil</a>),
but it is likely to be substantial. In most cases banks will refund the money
lost by their customers due to phishing attacks, although they reserve the right
not to refund such losses at their discretion. Estimates by the Association for
Payment Clearing Services (<a href="http://www.apacs.org.uk/">APACS</a>) for the
cost of phishing attacks against UK banks were <a
	href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/26/phishing_scams/">&pound;1M</a>
for the previous 18 months to April 2004, rising to <a
	href="http://software.silicon.com/security/0,39024655,39128476,00.htm">&pound;12M</a>
by March 2005. Australian estimates for March 2005 were <a
	href="http://www.paymentsnews.com/2005/03/phishing_attack.html">A$25M</a>,
whilst Financial Insights estimates the cost to US business to be <a
	href="http://www.financial-insights.com/FI/getdoc.jsp?containerId=FIN1492">$400M</a>
in 2004.&nbsp;A study by Gartner estimated the cost in 2003 to be <a
	href="http://www.gartner.com/5_about/press_releases/asset_71087_11.jsp">$1.2B</a>
and the number of reported phishing attacks have massively increased since
then.</p>

<p>In October 2004 the Anti-Phishing Working Group reported that it had seen
6597 new phishing emails, an increase of 36% on the previous month. 1142
phishing web sites were reported, double the number for September and part of a
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4037975.stm">&quot;bumper
	month&quot;</a> during a period of huge growth in automated phishing attacks.
Email filtering specialist <a href="http://www.messagelabs.com/">MessageLabs</a>
<a href="http://www.messagelabs.com/intelligence/2004report/">reported</a> that
it intercepted more than 18 million phishing messages during 2004, and the graph
below clearly shows the growth in attempted phishing attacks by email:</p>

<p>The loss of trust, impact on consumer confidence and the associated financial
costs of phishing attacks have become important enough for banks to set up web
sites such as <a href="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk/">BankSafe Online</a> to
try and educate their customers, and most target brands now provide sections of
their official web site with advice on identifying and avoiding online scams
(such as Citizen Bank's &quot;<a
	href="http://www.citizensbank.com/misc/prevention_center.asp">Online Fraud
	Prevention Centre</a>&quot; or Citibank's "<a
	href="http://www.citibank.com/domain/spoof/learn.htm">Learn About Spoofs</a>"
pages ). Other organisations such as the <a
	href="http://www.antiphishing.org">Anti Phishing Working Group</a> are also
hoping to educate consumers as to the potential risks and teach Internet users
how to avoid online scams such as phishing attacks. However, the main challenge
in preventing phishing attacks is that phishing is not a pure technology problem
- the major contributing factor is human nature, and as long as attackers can
continue to create schemes to trick unwary users, phishing will continue to be
successful and potentially lucrative. As Bruce Schneier writes <a
	href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html">in a
	recent weblog</a>, even issuing all end users with two-factor authentication
doesn't really help to solve the problem if the phisher is successful in
tricking the users into authenticating themselves against a fake, malicious
system. Given the combination of human nature, the rapid rate of technological
change and the potential for illegitimate profits to be made, it seems safe to
assume that the problem of phishing will get worse before it gets better.</p>
