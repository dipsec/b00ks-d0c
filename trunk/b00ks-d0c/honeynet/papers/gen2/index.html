The GenII (2nd generation) Honeynet is the next step in the evolution
of honeynet technology.  Based on combining old and new techniques,
the GenII Honeynet can increase the flexibility, manageability, and security 
of honeynet deployments.  This paper introduces the technology used in
a GenII Honeynet architecture.
However, before you proceed, it is assumed that you have already read and 
fully understand the concepts, risks, and issues of Honeynets outlined in 
<a href="../honeynets/">Know Your Enemy: Honeynets</a>.  It is critical
that you understand the basic concepts and  risks of honeynets before 
covering the technical details.

<p>
This paper is an end-to-end overview of the components of a GenII
Honeynet.  You can use the methods discussed below to manually build
your own honeynet.  However, we suggest  instead that you use the
<a href="../../tools/cdrom/index.html">Honeywall CDROM</a>, as it
automates all of the functionality discussed below (and much more).
The first section introduces the concept of a honeywall, the
administrative mechanism that will be the focus of our network's
management capability.  In the Data Control section we discuss the
process of limiting the actions attackers can take on our network.  The
third section, Data Capture, details methods to covertly capture attacker
activity at both the host and network level.  The Automated Alerting
section covers methods to notify administrators of possible successful attacks.  
Finally, the Testing section presents a series of ways to test the configuration of 
the previous steps.  The deployment we describe is based on a honeywall running a
Linux 2.4.X kernel on standard x86 hardware.  You are not required to use 
the tools or methods discussed here, you can use any technologies you feel 
the most comfortable with, as long as it provides the same functionality.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>The Architecture</font></font></b><br>
As we discussed in <a href="../honeynet/">KYE: Honeynets</a> a 
honeynet is an architecture, a highly controlled network used to contain and analyze 
attackers in the wild.  How you deploy that architecture is up to you.  We also
discussed the document <a href="../../alliance/requirements.html">Honeynet Definitions, 
Requirements, and Standards</a> which outlined the requirements of Honeynet deployments. 
This paper details one specific method of meeting those requirements.    The 
<a href="../../tools/cdrom/index.html">Honeywall CDROM</a> uses  these tools and techniques,
in addtion to new functionality such as data analysis.
The key element of any honeynet is the gateway, this is what seperates the honeynet victims.
from the rest of the world.  The gateway acts as a wall, in fact we call the gateway a honeywall.
All traffic entering or leaving the honeynet must go through this honeywall.  This becomes 
your command and control center for the honeynet, all the magic happens here.   You can see an 
example of our honeynet architecture in <a href="figureA.jpg">Figure A</a>.  In this example, 
our gateway is a layer two bridge.  A layer three routing gateway can be used, but a bridge is preferred,
as it is harder to detect.  In our diagram, our honeynet 
is deployed on an internal 192.168.1.0/24 network. In the past, most honeynets have traditionally 
been deployed on external or perimiter networks.  With the use of a layer two gateway, 
honeynets can now also integate with internal networks, as our is.  This allows us to track and 
learn not only about exteranl threat, but potentially internal threats. 

<p>
The honeywall (the bridge gateway) seperates production systems from
the honeynet network, populated by our victim targets.  The external interface of our
gateway (eth0) is connected to the production systems' network.  The internal interface of our
gateway (eth1) is connected to the honeynet systems' network.  Since this is a bridge, both
internal and external systems are on the same IP network.  We also have a third
interface (eth2).  The purpose of this interface is for remote admininstration of the
gateway, including moving any logs or captured data to a centralized point.  The 
internal and external interfaces will
be in bridging mode so they have no IP address assigned to them.  However, the third 
interface (eth2) has an IP stack assigned to it, in this example the IP address 10.1.1.1.
This network is a seperate, secured network used for administration purposes.
The advantages of this architecture is the gateway is difficult to detect, as there 
is no routing hops, no TTL decrement, nor any MAC addresses associated with the gateway.  
Also, we can simplify honeynet deployment by combining both Data Control and Data Capture on 
the single gateway.
The next step is to build our gateway to support this architecture.  For our gateway we are 
using a minimized, secured installation of Linux.  It is critical that this
is a trusted system, that no attacker can access our gateway.  
Next, we have to ensure our gateway 
supports IPTables firewall in bridging mode. Most Linux distributions support this by default.  If your system
does not, you can get bridging kernel path at
<a href="http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/">http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/</a>.
IPTables is critical, as not only will it help secure our gateway, we will
be using it for Data Control (discussed later).  Firewalling capabilities are critical,
as they are not only used to secure your honeywall gateway, but used for Data Control.



<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Data Control</font></font></b><br>
As we discussed in the <a href="../papers/honeynet">KYE: Honeynet</a> paper, the purpose 
of Data Control is to prevent attackers using the honeynet to attack or harm other non-honeynet 
systems.  Data Control mitigates risk, it does not eliminate it.  With Data Control, one
of the questions you have to answer is
how much outbound activity do you control?  The more you allow the attacker to do, the
more you can learn.  However, the more you allow the attacker to do, the more harm they
can potentially cause.  So, you have to contain their activity enough so they
can't harm other folks, but you can't contain it too much or minimize what you learn.
How much you allow an attacker to do ultimately depends on how much risk you
are willing to assume.  To make this even more challenging, we have to contain the
attacker without them knowing we are containing them.  To accomplish just this, we will 
be implementing two technlogies, connection counting and NIPS.  Connection counting is
when we limit how many outbound connections a honeypot can initiate.  NIPS (Network
Intrusion Prevention System) can block (or disable) known attacks.  Combined, these two
technologies make a redundant and flexible data control mechanism.  We will be implementing
both technologies on our layer two gateway.  We implement Data Control
on the gateway because this is where all inbound and outbound traffic must flow through, its
a choke point for the attacker's activity.


<p>
Once you have your gateway configured as described in part one, the next step is implementing connection
limiting, we contain how many outbound connections an attacker can initiate from
a honeypot.  The purpose here is to count outbound connections, and when a certain
limit has been met, block any more connections.  This is primarily used to reduce the
risk of mass scanning, attacking, or denial of service attacks, activity that requires many
outbound connections.  We use IPTables for this, which
is configured and implemented by the rc.firewall script which comes with the Honeynet CDROM. In
IPTables, we set how many times an attacker can initiate a TCP, UDP, ICMP, or OTHER outbound
connection.  How many connections you allow depend on how much risk you are willing
to assume.  Limiting the number of outbound connections prevents attackers from using the
honeynet to scan or attack large numbers of other systems, or to launch Denial of
Service attacks.  Its hard to do alot of damage when you are limited to the number
of connections you can initiate outbound.   However, keep in mind that this can also
become a signature.  An attacker may be able to detect your honeynet simply by initiating
outbound connections, and seeing if they are blocked after a certain number.  The default for connection 
limits in Honeywall CDROM is as follows.  Note, the variable OTHER is any IP 
protocol that is NOT TCP, UDP, or ICMP (such as IPsec, IPv6 tunneling, Network Voice Protocl, 
etc).

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>
### Set the connection outbound limits for different protocols.</br>
SCALE="day"<br>
TCPRATE="15"<br>
UDPRATE="20"<br>
ICMPRATE="50"<br>
OTHERRATE="15"<br>
</font></font>

<p>
This is how IPTables implements connection limiting.  When an attacker breaks into
a honeypot, they may initiate connections out of the network for a variety of reasons
(download toolkits, setup automated bots, IRC chats, send emails, etc).  Everytime
time one of these connections is initiated outbound, the firewall counts them.  When
the limit is reached, IPTables blocks anymore connections from that honeypot.  Then,
IPTables resets itself, allowing as many connections outbound per time scale
allowed.  For example, lets say we set our TCP limit to 25 outbound connections 
per day.  When the attacker breaks into our honeypot, they are allowed 25 outbound
TCP connections.  When they reach the limit of 25 TCP connections, they cannot start anymore.  
IPTables then resets itself allowing 25 more connections out over whatever the scale
is, in this case 25 connections over the next 24 hours, limiting one connection per hour.  
If we had set the scale to hour, then once the limit was met, it would have allowed 25 connections 
over each successvie hour, or one connection every 2.4 minutes.  To see a real world
example of this behavor, refer to <a href="win2000.txt">these IPTable logs</a> of a 
Win2000 honeypot infected with the Code Red II worm, and its attempt to scan outbound.
One nice feature of IPTables, when the TCP limit has been met, it does not effect any
of the UDP, ICMP or OTHER traffic, until their limits have been met also.


<p>
Once you have implemented connection limiting, the next step 
is implementing NIPS functionality.  Remember, the purpose of our NIPS is to identify and block 
known attacks.  It does this by inspecting each packet as it travels through our gateway.
If any packet matches any of the IDS rules, not only is an alert generated (like a 
traditional NIDS) but the packet can be dropped (blocking the attack) or modified (disabling
the attack). The advantage is we dramatically reduce the risk of a known outbound attack being
successful. The disadvantate is this works with only known attacks. In the case of rate limiting, 
we are allowing by default 15 outbound TCP
connections a day.  What happens if your honeynet gets infected with a worm, and in those
first 15 outbound connections it attempts to infect other systems?  While rate limiting has
reduced the number of systems it can infect, you still have that risk.  The idea of an NIPS
is it would block or disable any known attacks indetified in those first 15 connections.  For this, 
we use the <a href="http://snort-inline.sf.net"> Snort_inline</a>, functionality that has been
integrated into the new version of <a href="http://www.snort.org">Snort</a>.


<p>
For snort_inline to work as a NIPS (in gateway mode) it has to have something route the packets
for it, snort_inline does not know how to act as a router (ip_forward).  So, we have something
route packets for snort_inline, and during the routing process the packet is given to snort_inline
for analysis.  Once snort_inline is done with the packet, it hands it back to the routing process.  
That process is IPTables.  We configure IPTables to take packets it
is forwarding, put them in user space for snort_inline to analyze, then
IPTables continues to route the packet.  This feature of IPTables is
called user-space queuing, as it requires the ip_queue module to be
loaded into the kernel.  One thing to keep in mind when combining snort_inline and
IPTables counting capabilities, IPTables will count the outbound connection
regardless if snort_inline allows the packet through or blocks the
packet.  That is because all packets traverse through the internal interface
first before being analyzed by snort_inline.  The connection has been counted
before snort_inline ever sees it.  



<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1> 
If you enable snort_inline capabilities, then you 
you MUST have snort_inline running.  If you do not have snort_inline
running, or if for some reason snort_inline should die, then no packets will route
through IPtables (this is a fail safe feature, not a bug :). As such, our 
next step is to configure snort_inline.  This is very similar to snort, execpt 
it uses a different rulebase.   Keep in mind, our goal is not to drop all 
outbound traffic, only attacks.  So, we want to use a ruleset that only has actual 
attacks or exploits.  You do not want to block outbound informational queries,
such as ICMP ping, finger query, or a simple HTTP GET command.
If we use ALL the Snort rules, then the attacker will once again not
be able to do anything outbound.  As such, we only use the Snort rules
that define actual attacks.  Each organization may have a different
definition of what an attack is, so we recommend that you review and
modify the snort_inline rules before using them.  Also, our ruleset has to 
be reversed from a typical Snort rulebase, as these focus on inbound attacks.  
With Snort_inline, we want to focus on outbound attacks.  The goal is to protect 
the outside world from the honeynet.  Last, the rules are different, 
as we are not alerting on activity, but actually dropping or modifying 
attacks. 
 
A <a href="figureB.gif">drop ruleset</a> purpose is to analyze
packets, and if it sees an outbound attack, to block or drop the packet
containing the attack.  You can see a specific example of this in the
dropping of the <a href="cr2.txt">Code Red II</a> attack we mentioned earlier.
A <a href="figureC.gif">replace ruleset</a> does not block attacks.  Instead, 
it modifies the contents of the actual attack,
disabling the exploit.  This is potentialy a more difficult control method
for the attacker to detect.  They will see their attacks reaching their
intended targets, but not be able to figure out why the attacks are failing.
The tool <a href="../../tools">snortconfig</a> is a flexible script that converts
standard Snort rules to snort-inline capabilities, such as drop, sdrop, or
replace.  This tool is very important to maintaining a current snort-inline
ruleset.


<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Data Capture</font></font></b><br>
Once we have deployed Data Control, we can deploy Data Capture.  The purpose of Data Capture
is to log all of the attacker's activity.  This is the whole purpose of the honeynet,
to collect information.  Without Data Capture, our honeynet has no value. The key to
Data Catpure is collecting information at as many layers as possible.  No single layer
tells us everything.  For example, many people think all you need is the attacker's
keystrokes, however this is not true.  What happens when the attacker launches a tool, 
how will you know what the tool does if you do not capture the tool itself, or the network 
traffic?   The Honeynet Project has identified three critical layers of Data Capture; 
firewall logs, network traffic, and system activity.  We will detail how to implement all 
three of these.

<p>
Firewall logs are very simple, we already did that part.  By implementing
IPTablesfirewall script, we are already logging all inbound and outbound connections
to /var/log/messages.  This information is critical, as its our first indication
of what an attacker is doing.  Its also our first warning when outbound attacks
have been initiated.  Based on our experience, firewall logs have
proved critical in quickly identifying new or unknown behaviour.  The Honeywall CDROM
identified four different types of traffic; TCP, UDP, ICMP,
and OTHER.  Just as with Data Control, OTHER represents any non-IP proto 1, 6, or 17 type traffic.  It also
tends to be the most interesting, when someone is using non-standard IP traffic,
they are most likely trying a new attack or method never published before (as in the
backdoor channel seen in <a href="../../scans/scan22/">Scan of the Month 22</a>.

<p>
The second element is capturing every packet and its full payload as it enters
or leaves the honeynet.  While the snort_inline process could conceivably do
this, we don't want to put all of our eggs into one basket.  Instead, we configure
and run a second process to capture all of this activity.  We do this by using 
a standard Snort process to capture all IP traffic, regardless of the IP type.
In the startup script we bind the
sniffer to the internal interface, eth1.  This is critical.  If by mistake
you bind the sniffer to the external interface (eth0) not only will you 
log honeynet data, but all other traffic related to the external network.
This will pollute the data you capture. By sniffing from the internal
interface, you will capture only inbound and outbound honeynet traffic,
which is exactly what you want.  


<p>
The third element is the most challenging, capturing the attacker's activity
on the honeypot itself.  Years ago this was simple, as most remote interaction with
systems was done over cleartext protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, or Telnet.
You merely had to sniff the connections to capture keystrokes.
However, attackers, just like you, have adopted encryption.  Nowadays
they are just as likely to use SSH or 3DES channels to communicate with 
compromised computers.  We can no longer capture keystrokes off the wire, 
instead grab them from the system itself.  One advantage to this system is
that most encrypted is decrypted at the system end point, in our case the
honeypot.  If we could capture the data as its decrypted on the honeypot,
we can bypass encrypted communications.  <a href="../../tools/sebek/">Sebek</a> 
is a tool designed to do just that. Sebek is a hidden kernel module (or patch) capable of 
logging attacker's activity.  Once installed on a honeypot, the Sebek client runs in the kernel.
The information gathered by the Sebek client is not stored on the honeypot where it can be
discovered by the attacker.  Instead, the Sebek client transmits its data via UDP to a 
a sniffing machine (such as the honeywall gateway, or a remote logging system on 
another network).  Attackers cannot see nor sniff these packets, as the Sebek
client on the honeypots hide them.  Even if attackers download or use their
own sniffing tools, Sebek activity should be hidden from them.  This is done
by modifying the honeypot so it cannot see nor sniff any packets with a
predesignated magic number and UDP port.  Sebek then simply dumps the attacker's collected
information on the wire, which are then captured by the gateway.  Since all the honepyots 
are controlled with Sebek, none of them can be used to sniff keystrokes dumped on the wire.    
Note, if you have a honeypot that does not have Sebek installed, (or Sebek improperly
configured) and an attacker takes control of that system, then they can now sniff Sebek 
packets coming from other systems as those packets are not hidden.

<p>
As Sebek runs in the kernel, it has to be compiled for the specific
OS and kernel version of your honeypot.   While each client version is
different for different operating systems, they all come with the same
configuration file.  The purpose of the configuration
file is to determine what information is gathered, and how that information
is dumped to the wire.  By default, Sebek captures all activity on the
system, however you have the option of capturing keystroke activity only.
The combination of a magic number (Sebek specific) and the destination UDP port
number determine what packets will be hidden.  All honeypots in the same
group must share the same combination to work effectively.
Once configured, Sebek dumps all system activity to the network.
These packets are then used to reconstruct the attacker's activities, and the
impact it had on the system.  To learn more about Sebek, refer to the
paper <a href="../sebek.pdf">Know Your Enemy: Sebek</a>.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Alerting</font></font></b><br>
There is one last element you need to consider before finishing your honeynet,
alerting.  Having someone break into your honeynet is a great learning
experience, unless you are unaware that someone has broken into it.  Ensuring
that you are notified to a compromise (and responding to it) are
critical for a successful honeynet.  Ideally you could have round-the-clock 
monitoring by a seasoned admin.  However, for organizations that cannot support
24/7 staff, one alternative is automated alerting.  One option for automated
monitoring is <a href="http://swatch.sourceforge.net">Swatch, the Simple Watcher</a>.  
Swatch is an automated monitoring tool that is capable of alerting
administrators of possible successful attacks on the honeynet.
Swatch monitors log files for patterns described in a configuration
file.  When a pattern is found it can disseminate alerts via
email, system bells, phone calls, and can be extended to run other
commands/programs.  A simple Swatch rule contains the pattern to watch
for followed by a list of actions to take.  
By default Swatch will include in email alerts the line in the log file that 
matched the given rule.  An example email for the above rule would look like
the example  below.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1>
Even with the automated tools described in the Data Control section, an
effective honeynet requires constant supervision.  Properly configured,
Swatch can be used to quickly notify administrators of events on their
network.  However, do not depend on outbound connections as your only
source of alerting.  For example, attacker may compromise the system,
but never attempt an outbound connection.  Be sure to montior other
sources of information, such as keystrokes collected by the Sebek clients.
More advanced detection, reporting,
and alerting mechanisms are under development  for the Honeywall CDROM.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Testing</font></font></b><br>
Once we have configured Data Control and Data Capture, the next step will be
to test the gateway.  To test your deployment, below are some basics steps
you can take.  The Honeywall CDROM comes with a more thorough test plan, 
which can be found in the documentation section. To test the gateway, we will need a system on the
external interface, we will call this the test system.  Based on 
<a href="figureA.jpg">Figure A</a>, we will use the system 192.168.1.20 as 
our test system.  We begin by first testing Data Control, does our honeynet 
successfully contain inbound and outbound activity?.  
First, initiate a connection from the test system to one of the honeypots
within the honeynet.  Based on your ruleset, this connection should have
most likely been allowed.    If so, you would have an entry similar to this
in /var/log/iptables

<p>

</font></font>

<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1>
Once you have confirmed inbound connectivity is working, the next step is to test outbound.
Begin by accessing one of the honeypots behind the gateway, (we recommend you access
honeypots from the console, as the honeypot will log locally any remote connections, such as
SSH) .  From there, initiate multiple outbound connections to the test system.  This
will replicate one of the honeypots has been compromised, and an attacker
is attempting to initiate outbound connections, and potentially an attack.
The connections should be logged to /var/log/iptables on the Honeywall CDROM.  
In our case, we can attempt multiple outbound FTP connections to the test
system on the production network. When our limit of 15 TCP connections is hit, 
a "Drop TCP" entry is logged.
You would most likely have entries similar to this.

Next, we will want to confirm that our NIPS technology, snort_inline is
working.  Fortunately, the snort-inline toolkit comes with test rules, designed 
specifically for test.  Be sure to enable those rules before testing 
snort_inline. The rulebase you are running will also determine which test you run.  
If you are running a drop ruleset, you test by simply by first enabling the default
test rule, restart snort_inline using the 
start script, then attempt an outbound Telnet connection.  Snort_inline should detect,
drop, and log the attempt.  Your Telnet attempt should not work, it should simply 
time out.  If you are running a replace ruleset, you test by 
enabling the default replace test rule, restart snort_inline, then attempt a simple HTTP GET command.  
Snort_inline should detect, modify, and log the attmempt.  To confirm the modification happens,
be sure to sniff the EXTERNAL interface eth0.  Do NOT sniff the internal interface
eth1, as the GET command is not modified until after it passes through the
internal interface, but before it leaves the external interface.  Be sure that once 
you are done testing, you disable the rules (or the bad guys could simply run the 
default tests also).

Once we confirm Data Control we then want to ensure that Data Capture
is working.  Remember, if our honeynet is not logging all activity,
then the honeynet has no value.  We confirm Data Capture by looking
at the logs, did the Honeynet capture the Data Control test we just
ran?  We begin with the firewall logs.  This test is simple, all of
our connections should have been logged to /var/log/iptables.  Specifically,
we should first see the inbound connections from the test system to
the honeypot.  Second, we should see the outbound connections from
the honeypot to the test system. Last, we should see an alert message
indicating that the outbound limit has been met, and all further
connections will be dropped.  We already tested this when we confirmed
Data Control
Next, we review the network logs.  We want to be sure we captured
every packet and the full payload of every connection, both inbound
and outbound.  Based on experience, we have found its best to rotate
the logs on daily basis.  
The log we are primarily interested in is the binary log capture,
called snort.log.*.  In addition, you may find various directories
made up IP addressess.  These contain the any output of packets
containing ASCII content, such as FTP commands or an .html page.
You can confirm Snort logged all packets by analyzing the binary
log file, as follows:

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>
honeywall #snort -vdr snort.log.*
</font></font>

Finally we review the Sebek logs.  These are the keystrokes captured
by the Sebek kernel module, then dumped onto the network.  These
packets should have been captured by the network sniffer (Snort).  Its
highly recommend you  use  the GUI interface WAlleye that comes with the
Honeywall CDROM for all  Sebek analysis.  If you were able to analyze the collected data, you
Data Capture is working successfully!  Also, check your email, you should
have been alerted to the test you just ran.  Swatch should have alerted you to
your own tests that you just ran.  Now, since you are a true
security professional, we know you are going to reboot your honeynet
gateway and test Data Control and Data Capture one more time, just to be sure.
Also, we encourage organizations to do more extensive testing, as documented
in the Honeywall CDROM docs section.

We have just completed an overview of how to build and deploy a GenII Honeynet
based on a bridging gateway using Linux.  This deployment represents some of
the more advanced features of honeynet technology.  However, keep in mind that
information security is similar to an arms race, as we release new technologies
to capture attacker activities, these very same threats can develop their own
counter measures.   If  you are interested in deploying your own honeynet,
we highly recommend the <a href="../../tools/cdrom/index.html">Honeywall
CDROM</a>.
