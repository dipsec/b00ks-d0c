One of the challenges of network
security is learning about the bad guys.  To understand your threats
and better protect against them, you have to <a href="../enemy/index.html">Know
Your Enemy</a>.  Passive Fingerprinting is a method to learn more
about the enemy, without them knowing it.  Specifically, you can determine
the operating system and other characteristics of the remote host using
nothing more then sniffer traces.  Though not 100% accurate, you can
get surprisingly good results. The subterrain crew has developed 
<a href="http://siphon.datanerds.net/"> siphon</a>, a passive 
network and system mapping and OS fingerprinting tool.  Also,
Michael Zalewski (Poland's finest) and Bill Stearns are maintaining
<a href="http://www.stearns.org/p0f/">p0f</a>.   Both of these tools demonstrate
the functionality we are about to discuss.

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1>
Traditionally, Operating System
fingerprinting has been done using active tools, such as queso or nmap. 
These tools operate on the principle that every operating system's IP stack
has its own idiosyncrasies.  Specifically, each operating system responds
differently to a variety of malformed packets.  All one has to do
is build a database on how different operating systems respond to different
packets.  Then, to determine the operating system of a remote host,
send it a variety of malformed packets, determine how it responds, then
compare these responses to a database.  Fyodor's <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap">nmap</a>
is tool of choice when using this methodology.  He has also written
a <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap-fingerprinting-article.html">
detailed paper</a> on this.

<p>
Passive fingerprinting follows the
same concept, but is implemented differently.  Passive fingerprinting
is based on sniffer traces from the remote system.  Instead of actively
querying the remote system, all you need to do is capture packets sent
from the remote system.  Based on the sniffer traces of these packets,
you can determine the operating system of the remote host.  Just like
in active fingerprinting, passive fingerprinting is based on the principle
that every operating system's IP stack has its own idiosyncrasies. 
By analyzing sniffer traces and identifying these differences,  you
may be able determine the operating system of the remote host.
<br> 
<p><b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>The Signatures</font></font></b>
<br>There are four TCP areas that we will look at to determine the operating system (however
there are other signatures that can be used). These signatures are:
<ul>
<li>
TTL - What the operating system sets
the Time To Live on the outbound packet</li>

<li>
Window Size - What the operating system
sets the Window Size at.</li>

<li>
DF - Does the operating system set the
Don't Fragment bit.</li>

<li>
TOS - Does the operating system set
the Type of Service, and if so, at what.</li>
</ul>

By analyzing these factors of a packet, you
may be able to determine the remote operating system.  This system
is not 100% accurate, and works better for some operating systems then
others.  No single signature can reliably determine the remote
operating system. However, by looking at several signatures and combining the 
information, you increase the accuracy of identifying the remote host. 
An example would be the easiest way to explain.  Below is
the sniffer trace of a system sending a packet. 
This system launched a mountd exploit against us, so we want to learn more
about it.  We do not want to finger or nmap the box, that could give
us away.  Rather, we want to study the information passively.  
This signature was captured using <a href="http://www.snort.org">snort</a>,
our passive weapon of choice.

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">
04/20-21:41:48.129662 129.142.224.3:659 -> 172.16.1.107:604<br>
TCP TTL:45 TOS:0x0 ID:56257<br>
***F**A* Seq: 0x9DD90553  <br>
Ack: 0xE3C65D7   Win: 0x7D78<br>
</font>

<p>Based on our 4 criteria, we identify
the following:

<ul>
<li>
TTL: 45</li>

<li>
Window Size: 0x7D78  (or 32120
in decimal)</li>

<li>
DF: The Don't Fragment bit is set</li>

<li>
TOS: 0x0</li>

</ul>

We then compare this information to
a <a href="traces.txt">database of signatures</a>.  First, we look
at the TTL used by the remote host.  From our sniffer trace above, 
you can see the TTL is set at 45.  This most likely means
it went through 19 hops to get to us, so the original TTL was set
at 64.  Based on this TTL, it appears this packet was sent from a Linux or 
FreeBSD box, (however, more system signatures need to be added to the database). 
This TTL is confirmed by doing a traceroute to the remote host.
If you are concerend about the remote host detecting your traceroute,
you can set your traceroute time-to-live (default 30 hops), to be one
or two hops less then the remote host (-m option).  For example, in this
case we would do a traceroute to the remote host, but using only 18
hops (traceroute -m 18). This gives you the path information 
(including their upstream provider) without actually touching the remote host.
For more information on TTLs, check out this 
<a href="http://secfr.org/docs/fingerprint/en/ttl_default.html">
Research Paper on Default TTL values</a>.
<p>
The next step is too compare the Window size. We have found the Window Size to 
be another effective tool, specifically what Window Size is used and how often the size 
changes.  In the above signature, we see it set at 0x7D78, a default Window 
Size commonly used by Linux.  Also, Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris tend to maintain 
the same Window Size throughout a session (as this one did). However, Cisco 
routers (at least my 2514) and Microsoft Windows/NT Window Sizes are constantly changing.  
We have found that Window Size is more accurate if measured after the initial three-way handshake
(due to TCP slow start).  For more information on Window Size, see Stevens,
"TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1" Chapter 20.
<p>
Most systems use the DF bit set, so this is of limited value.  However, 
this does make it easier to identify the few systems that do not use the DF flag
(such as SCO or OpenBSD). After
further testing, we feel that TOS is also of limited value.  This seems
to be more session based then operating system.  In other words, its not
so much the operating system that determines the TOS, but the protocol
used.  TOS defintely requires some more testing.  So, 
based on the information above, specifcally TTL and Window size,
you can compare the results to the <a href="traces.txt"> database of 
signatures</a> and with a degree of confidence determine the OS (in
our case, Linux kernel 2.2.x).

<p>
Keep in mind, just as with Active Fingerprinting, Passive Fingerprinting
has some limitations.  First, applications that build their own packets
(such as nmap, hunt, nemesis, etc) will not use the same signatures as
the operating system.  Second, it is relatively simple for a remote host 
to adjust the TTL, Window Size, DF, or TOS setting on packets.  For example,
to change the default TTL value:

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.rvs.uni-hannover.de/people/voeckler/tune/EN/tune.html">
Solaris:</b></a> ndd -set /dev/ip ip_def_ttl 'number'<br>

<b>Linux:</b> echo 'number' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl<br>

<b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q120/6/42.asp?LN=EN-US&SD=gn&FR=0">
NT:</b></a> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters

<p>
However, by combining a variety of different packets and signatures, in this case TTL
and Window Size, you can reliably approximate the remote system.
<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Other Signatures and Uses</font></font></b><br>
We are not limited to the four signatures discussed so far. There are 
other areas that can be tracked, such as initial sequence numbers, 
IP Identification numbers, TCP or IP options.  For example, Cisco routers 
tend to start IP Identification numbers at 0, instead of
randomly assigning them.  For TCP Options, the option Selective Acknowledgement
<a href="../finger/rfc2018.txt">SackOK</a>
is commonly used by Windows and Linux, but not commonly used by 
FreeBSD or Solaris.  With Maximum Segment Size (MSS), most operating
systems use a MSS of 1460, however Novell commonly uses 1368, and some
FreeBSD variants may use a MSS of 512.  

Also, ICMP packets can be used.  Honeynet member Ofir
Arkin has done extensive research in using ICMP for fingerprinting, publishing
the paper <a href="http://www.sys-security.com/archive/papers/ICMP_Scanning_v3.0.pdf">
ICMP Usage in Scanning</a>.  The ICMP signatures  he discusses in this paper can
be used for passively fingerprinting systems based on their ICMP signatures.  For 
example, Microsoft ICMP REQUEST payloads contain the alphabet, while most Unix systems,
such as Solaris or Linux,  ICMP REQUEST payloads have number and symbols. 




<p>
Passive fingerprinting can be used for several other purposes. It can be used 
by the bad guys as 'stealthy' fingerprinting.  For example, to determine 
the Operating System of a 'potential victim', such as a webserver, one only 
needs to request a webpage from the server, then analyze the sniffer traces.  
This bypasses the need for using an active tool that can be detected by various 
IDS systems.  Also, Passive Fingerprinting may be used to identify remote
proxy firewalls.  Since proxy firewalls rebuild connection for clients, it may
be possible to ID the proxy firewalls based on the signatures we have discussed.
Organizations can use Passive Fingerprinting to identify 'rogue' systems on
their network. These would be systems that are not authorized on the network.
For example, a Microsoft or Sun shop can quickly identify 'rogue' Linux
or FreeBSD systems that mysteriously appeared on their network.  Passive 
Fingerprinting can be used to quickly inventory an organizations operating systems without
touching or imapcting any systems or network performance. You would be surprised how
may organizations do not know what systems they have on their internal network. For individuals 
conducting security assessment, Passive Fingerprinting also allows one to quickly identify 
critical systems (such as Unisys Mainframe).  This method can also be used to identify
rogue or unautorized systetms or OS types within an organization, a possible indication
of  'blackhat' activity.


<p>
<br>The Project has developed a<a href="../finger/traces.txt"> 
test database</a> to demonstrate these concepts of passive fingerprinting.  The database was
built by testing a variety of systems with the Telnet, FTP, HTTP, and SSH protocol.    This
database is no longer being developed and is provided for demonstration purposes only.  If you
want to contribute to the development of passive fingerprinting, we recommend the actively
maintained solutions we have discussed so far.

<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Conclusion</font></font></b>
<br>Passive fingerprinting gives you the ability to learn about the enemy, 
without them knowing it.  Though no single piece of information can positively
identify a operating system, by combining several signatures, you can make an
approximation of the remote system.  A big thanks to the following people for their
