This paper is a continuation of the 
<a href="../enemy/index.html">Know
Your Enemy</a> series. The first three papers covered the tools and tactics
of the black-hat community.&nbsp; This paper, the fourth of the series,
studies step by step a successful attack of a system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, instead of focusing on the tools and tactics used, we will focus
on how we learned what happened and pieced the information together.&nbsp;
The purpose is to give you the forensic skills necessary to analyze and
learn on your own the threats your organization faces.  There is also an
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/437641.asp">online, interactive version</a>
of this paper published by MSNBC.
<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Background</font></font></b>
<br>The information covered here was obtained through the use of a 
<a href="../honeypot/index.html">honeypot</a>.&nbsp;
The honeypot was a default server installation of Red Hat 6.0.&nbsp; No
modifications were made to the default install, so the vulnerabilities
discussed here exist on any default RH 6.0 installation.&nbsp; Also, none 
of the data presented here has been sanitized.&nbsp; All IP addresses,
user accounts, and keystrokes discussed here are real.&nbsp; This is done
on purpose to both validate the data and give a better understanding of
forensic analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the passwords have been modified to 
protect the compromised systems. All sniffer information presented here is
in snort format.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.snort.org">
Snort</a> is my sniffer
and IDS system of choice, due to its flexibility, capabilities, and price
(its free).&nbsp; All actions commited by the black-hat were captured with
snort. I use the IDS signatures supplied by Max Vision at 
<a href="http://www.whitehats.com">www.whitehats.com</a>.&nbsp;
You can query his arachNIDs database for more information on all the alerts
discussed throughout this paper.&nbsp; You can find my snort configuration and
signature file (including the command line options I use)
<a href="../forensics/snort.txt">here</a>.
Once you are done reading the paper, you can conduct your own forensic
analysis, as I have supplied all the <a href="../forensics/forensics.tar.gz">raw
data.</a>&nbsp; As you read this paper, take note of how many different
systems the black-hat uses.&nbsp; Also, throughout this paper, the black-hat
is identified as she, but we have no idea what the true gender is.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>The Attack</font></font></b>
<br>On 26 April, at 06:43 snort alerted me that one of my systems had be attacked
with a 'noop' attack.&nbsp; Packet payloads containing noops are an indication
of a buffer overflow attack.&nbsp; In this case, snort had detected the
attack and logged the alert to my /var/log/messages file (which is monitored
by <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~lspitz/swatch.html">swatch</a>).  Note:
throughout this paper, the IP address 172.16.1.107 is the IP address of the honeypot.
All other systems are the IP addresses used by the black-hat.

<p>
My honeypots receive numerous probes, scans and queries on a 
<a href="../forensics/probed.txt">daily
basis</a>.&nbsp; However, an alert like this gets my immediate attention,
as it indicates a system may have been compromised.&nbsp; Sure enough,
less then two minutes later system logs indicate the system is compromised,
as our attacker initiates a connection and logins to the box.

Apr 26 06:44:36 victim7 PAM_pwdb[12521]: (su) session opened for user hantu by twin(uid=506)
</font></font></font>

<p>
Our intruder has gained super user access and now controls the system.&nbsp;
How was this accomplished, what happened?&nbsp; We will now begin our forensic
analysis and put the pieces together, step by step.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>The Analysis</font></font></b>
<br>
When studying an attack, the best place to start is the beginning,
where did the black-hat start?&nbsp; Black-hats normally start with information
gathering, they need to determine what vulnerabilities exist before they
can strike.&nbsp; If your system has been compromised, this is normally
not the first time the black-hat has communicated with that system.&nbsp;
Most attacks involve some type of&nbsp; information gathering before the
attack is launched.&nbsp; So, this is where we will start, the black-hat's
information gathering stage.
<p>
If we look at the alert above, the attack was on port 53.&nbsp; This
indicates a DNS attack was launched on our system.&nbsp; So I will begin
by looking through my <a href="../forensics/probed.txt">snort
alerts</a> and find possible information probes for DNS.&nbsp; We find
a DNS version query probe coming from the same system that attacked us.

</font></font></font>

<p>
Notice the date of the probe, April 25.&nbsp; Our system was attacked
April 26, from the same system.&nbsp; Our system was compromised the day
after the probe.&nbsp; I am guessing that an automated tool was used by
our black-hat to scan numerous systems for a known <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-03.html">
DNS vulnerability.</a>&nbsp; After the scan was ran, the black-hat reviewed
the results, identified vulnerable systems (including ours) and then launched
her exploit.&nbsp; We have now pieced together the first part of our story.&nbsp;
Our black-hat scanned us on 25 April, then exploited the system the following
day.&nbsp; Based on our IDS alerts, it appears we were hit by a 
<a href="../enemy/index.html">script
kiddie</a> with a well known DNS vulnerability.&nbsp; But how was the attack
launched, and how does it work?&nbsp; Lets find out.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>The Exploit</font></font></b>
<br>
Like most commercial IDS systems, snort has the capability of showing
us the packet load data of all IP packets.&nbsp; We will use this capability
to conduct an analysis of the exploit.&nbsp; The exploit information was
obtained from the snort logs (stored in tcpdump binary format).&nbsp; I
queried the snort log and began reviewing the packets starting when the
attack was launched.&nbsp; I did not limit my information query to the
host 63.236.81.13, as the attacker may have used other systems.&nbsp; This
is in fact the case, as our black-hat used at least three different systems
to run the exploit. The goal of the exploit is to gain a root shell on
the remote system.&nbsp; Once the black-hat gains a root shell, they can
run any command as root.&nbsp; Normally an account is placed in the /etc/passwd
and /etc/shadow file.&nbsp; You can find both the exploit and remote commands
executed in the <a href="../forensics/exploit.html">detailed
forensic analysis</a>.&nbsp; Once the exploit was ran and a root shell
obtained, the following commands were ran as root.

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>
cd /; uname -a; pwd; id;<br>
Linux apollo.uicmba.edu 2.2.5-15 #1 Mon Apr 19 22:21:09 EDT 1999 i586 unknown<br>
/<br>
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)<br>
echo "twin::506:506::/home/twin:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd<br>
echo "twin:w3nT2H0b6AjM2:::::::" >> /etc/shadow<br>
<p>
echo "hantu::0:0::/:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd<br>
echo "hantu:w3nT2H0b6AjM2:::::::" >> /etc/shadow<br>
</font></font></font>

<p>
Our black-hat runs several commands as root.&nbsp;
First, she confirms the system she is on (<b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>uname
-a</font></font></b>), the directory (<b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>pwd</font></font></b>)
and then confirms her uid (<b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>id</font></font></b>).&nbsp;
She then adds two user accounts to the system, <i>twin</i> and <i>hantu</i>,
both with the same password.&nbsp; Note that <i>twin</i> has the UID of
506 and <i>hantu</i> has the UID of 0 (on a side note, <i>hantu</i> means
ghost in Indonesian).&nbsp; Remeber, most systems do not let UID 0 telnet
to the box.  So she had to create an account that would give her remote
access, then another account that would give her UID 0. So, our black-hat 
ran an exploit on DNS, gained a root shell, then inserted two accounts.&nbsp; 
Within 90 seconds of the exploit she telnets into the box and gains root access (see timestamps of
logs below). So, what does she do next?

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Gaining Access</font></font></b>
<br>
Fortunately for us, telnet is a plaintext protocol, the data is not
encrypted.&nbsp; This means we can decode the sniffer traces and capture
all the her keystrokes.&nbsp; Snort has already done this for us, another reason
I prefer snort.&nbsp; By analyzing the keystrokes snort captured of the
telnet sessions, we can determine what our black-hat does.&nbsp; What I
like best about decoding telnet sessions as we capture not only STDIN (the
keystrokes) but STDOUT and STDER.&nbsp; Lets review the telnet sessions
and identify the black-hats activities (comments in
<b><font color="#CC0000">RED</font></b>).

<p>
<font color="#CC0000">
First, our friend telnets to the box (from 213.28.22.189)
as <i>twin</i> and then gains superuser access as <i>hantu</i>.  Remeber, she cannot
just telnet in as <i>hantu</i> as UID 0 is restricted for remote access.</font>

Once the system had been compromised, I took it offline to review the
data (such as Tripwire).&nbsp; However, I noticed over the next week that
a variety of systems were attempting to telnet to the box.&nbsp; Apparently
the black-hat wanted back in, most likely to use the compromised system
for more nefarious activity.&nbsp; So, I brought the compromised box back
online, curious to see if the black-hat would return and what she would
do.&nbsp; Sure enough, almost two weeks later, she returned.&nbsp; Once
again, we captured all the keystrokes using snort.&nbsp; Review the following
telnet sessions and learn how our compromised system was to be used as
a <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/trinoo.analysis">Trinoo client</a>.

she uses the backdoor VT9111 to get into the system, bypassing authentication.

Remember, DNS was exploited to gain root access, so the system can no longer resolve domain

Following this, several attempts were made to use the system as a Trinoo
attack against other systems. At this point I disconnected the system.&nbsp;
The black-hat intended to use the compromised system for destructive purposes
and little more could be gained from the monitoring the connection.

<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Summary</font></font></b>
<br>
We have just covered step by step how a honeypot was compromised, backdoored,
and eventually used for a Trinoo attack.&nbsp; On 25 April, the black-hat
first scanned the honeypot for which version of DNS version it was running.&nbsp;
The following day, on 26 April, she executed the NXT-Named exploit to gain
a root shell (see the <a href="../forensics/NXT-Howto.txt">NXT-Howto</a>
for a black-hat HOWTO on the exploit). Once she gained a root shell, she
created two system accounts, <i>twin</i> and <i>hantu</i>.&nbsp; Following
this she immediately telneted to the box, gained super user access, then
downloaded and installed her backdoor, 
<a href="../forensics/bj.txt">bj.c</a>.&nbsp;
She then executed a script to cover her tracks and then left the system.&nbsp;
Over the following weeks she attempted to connect to the system, however
it was offline.&nbsp; Finally, on May 9 she gained access, installed and
then executed Trinoo.&nbsp; At this point the honeypot was taken offline
for good.&nbsp; The majority of forensics was conducted using system logs
from the compromised system and snort logs and alerts.  Several other people
have contributed <a href="../forensics/analysis.txt">
additional analysis</a> of the attack.

<p>
<b><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><font size=+2>Conclusion</font></font></b>
<br>
We have just covered a step by step analysis of how a honeypot compromised.&nbsp;
The goal was to determine how the system was compromised using forensic
anaylisis of system and IDS logs.&nbsp; By analyzing this attack, you should
have a better understanding of what to expect and look for when analyzing
a system attack.  If you would like to learn more about how this information
was obtained, check out <a href="../honeypot.html">
To Build A Honeypot</a>.

<p>
I would like to thank both <a href="mailto:roesch@hiverworld.com">Marty
Roesch</a> and <a href="mailto:vision@whitehats.com">Max Vision</a> for
their contribution to the security community.&nbsp; What I have learned
here would not have been possible without their hard work.  All logs and 
information were forwarded to CERT before this information
was released.  Also, attempts were made to contact all IPs involved
in the attack.
