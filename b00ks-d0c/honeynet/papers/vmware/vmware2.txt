Trying to find a suitable vmmon module for your running kernel.

None of VMware GSX Server's pre-built vmmon modules is suitable for your running
kernel.  Do you want this script to try to build the vmmon module for your 
system (you need to have a C compiler installed on your system)? [yes] 

What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running 
kernel? [/lib/modules/2.4.18-19.7.x/build/include] 

Extracting the sources of the vmmon module.

Would you prefer to modify your existing networking configuration using the 
wizard or the editor? (wizard/editor/help) [wizard] editor

The following virtual networks have been defined:

. vmnet0 is bridged to eth0
. vmnet1 is a host-only network on subnet 10.10.10.0.
. vmnet8 is NAT network on a private subnet 0.0.0.0.

Do you wish to make any changes to the current virtual networks settings? 
(yes/no) [no] yes

Which virtual network do you wish to configure? (0-99) 0

but it is highly recommended that you use it as a bridged network.  Are you sure
you want to modify it? (yes/no) [no] yes

What type of virtual network do you wish to set vmnet0? 
(bridged,hostonly,nat,none) [bridged] none

. vmnet8 is NAT network on a private subnet 0.0.0.0.

Do you wish to make additional changes to the current virtual networks settings?
(yes/no) [no] yes

Which virtual network do you wish to configure? (0-99) 8

The network vmnet8 has been reserved for a NAT network.  You may change it, but 
it is highly recommended that you use it as a NAT network.  Are you sure you 
want to modify it? (yes/no) [no] yes

What type of virtual network do you wish to set vmnet8? 
(bridged,hostonly,nat,none) [nat] none
