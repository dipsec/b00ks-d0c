This article is the second of a series of articles. In the first article,
<A HREF="../enemy/index.html">Know Your Enemy</A>,
we covered the tools and methodologies of the Script Kiddie.  
Specifically, how they probe for vulnerabilities and then attack. 
The <A HREF="../enemy3/index.html">third paper</A>
covers what script kiddies do once they gain root.  Specifically,
how they cover their tracks and what they do next. This, the second paper, 
will cover how to track their movements.   Just as in the military,
you want to track the bad guys and know what they are doing.  We will
cover what you can, and cannot determine, with your system logs. 
You may be able to determine if you are being probed,  what you were
being probed for,  what tools were used, and if they successful. 
The examples provided here focus on Linux, but can apply to almost any
flavor of Unix.  Keep in mind, there is no guaranteed way to track
the enemy's every step.  However, this article is a good place to
start.

This article is not on Intrusion Detection, there are a variety of
excellent sources that cover IDS.  If you are interested in intrusion
detection, I recommend checking out applicatons such as <A HREF="http://www.nfr.net">Network
Flight Recorder</A>  or <A HREF="http://www.snort.org">snort</A>. 
This article focuses on intelligence gathering.  Specifically, how
to figure out what the enemy is doing by reviewing your system logs. 
You will be surprised how much information you will find in your own log
files.  However, before we can talk about reviewing your logs, we
first have to discuss securing your system logs.  Your log files are
worthless if you cannot trust the integrity of them.  The first thing
most black-hats do is alter log files on a compromised system.  There
are a variety of rootkits that will wipe out their presence from log files
(such as cloak), or alter logging all together (such as trojaned syslogd
binaries).  So, the first step to reviewing your logs is securing
your logs.
<P>
This means you will need to use a remote log server.  Regardless
of how secure your system is, you cannot trust your logs on a compromised
system.  If nothing else, the black-hat can simply do a 
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>rm -rf /*</FONT></FONT></B> 
on your system, wiping your hard drive clean. 
This makes recovering your logs somewhat difficult.  To protect against
this, you will want all your systems to log traffic both locally and to
a remote log server.  I recommend making your log server a dedicated
system, ie. the only thing it should be doing is collecting logs from other
systems..  If money is an issue, you can easily build a linux box
to act as your log server.  This server should be highly secured,
with all services shut off, allowing only console access (see 
<A HREF="http://www.enteract.com/~lspitz/linux.html">Armoring
Linux</A> for an example).   Also, ensure that port 514 UDP is
blocked or firewalled at your Internet connection.  This protects
your log server from receiving bad or un-authorized logging information
from the Internet.
<P>
For those of you who like to get sneaky, something I like to do is recompile
syslogd to read a different configuration file, such as /var/tmp/.conf. 
This way the black-hat does not realize where the real configuration file
is. This is simply done by changing the entry "/etc/syslog.conf" in the
source code to whatever file you want.  We then setup our new configuration
file to log both locally and to the remote log server 
(<A href="../enemy2/syslog.txt">see
example</A>).  Make sure you maintain a standard copy of the configuration
file, /etc/syslog.conf, which points to all local logging.  Even though
this configuration file is now useless, this will throw off the black-hat
from realizing the true destination of our remote logging.  Another
option for your systems is to use a secure method of logging.  One
option is to replace your syslogd binary with something that has integrity
checking and a greater breadth of options.  One option is syslog-ng,
which you can find at  <A HREF="http://www.balabit.hu/products/syslog-ng.html">http://www.balabit.hu/products/syslog-ng.html</A>
<BR> 
<P>
Most of the logs we will use are the ones stored on the remote log server. 
As mentioned earlier, we can be fairly confident of the integrity of these
logs since they are on a remote and secured system.  Also, since all
systems are logging to a single source, it is much easier to identify patterns
in these logs.  We can quickly review what's happening to all the
systems in one source.  The only time you would want to review logs
stored locally on a system is to compare them to what the log server has.  
You can determine if the local logs have been altered by comparing them
to the remote logs.

By looking at your log entries, you can usually determine if you are
being port scanned.  Most Script Kiddies scan a network for a single
vulnerability.  If your logs show most of your systems being connected
from the same remote system, on the same port, this is most likely an exploit
scan.  Basically, the enemy has an exploit for a single vulnerability,
and they are scanning your network for it.  When they find it, they
exploit it.  For most Linux systems, TCP Wrappers is installed by
default.  So, we would find most of these connections in /var/log/secure. 
For other flavors of Unix, we can log all inetd connections by launching
inetd with the "-t" flag, facility daemon. A typical exploit scan would
look like something below.  Here we have a source scanning for the
wu-ftpd vulnerability.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Here we see the source <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>192.168.11.200</FONT></FONT>
scanning our network.  Notice how the source sequentially scans each
IP (this is not always the case).  This is the advantage of having
a log server, you can more easily identify patterns in your network since
all the logs are combined.  The repeated connections to port 21, ftp,
indicated they were most likely looking for the wu-ftpd exploit. 
We have just determined what the black-hat is looking for.  Often,
scans tend to come in phases.  Someone will release code for an imap
exploit, you will suddenly see a rush of imaps scans in your logs. 
The next month  you will be hit by ftp.  An excellent source
for current exploits is <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/">http://www.cert.org/advisories/</A> 
Sometimes,  tools will scan for a variety of exploits at the same
time, so you may see a single source connecting to several ports.
<P>
Keep in mind, if you are not logging the service, you will not know
if you are scanned for it.  For example, most rpc connections are
not logged.  However, many services can simply be added to /etc/inetd.conf
for logging with TCP Wrappers.  For example, you can add an entry
in /etc/inetd.conf for NetBus. You can define TCP Wrappers to safely deny
and log the connections (see <A HREF="http://www.enteract.com/~lspitz/ids.html">Intrusion
Detection</A> for more info on this).
</font>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+2>What's the Tool?</FONT></B>
<BR>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Sometimes you can actually determine the tools being used to scan your
network.  Some of the more basic tools scan for a specific exploit,
such as <A HREF="../enemy2/ftp-scan.txt">ftp-scan.c</A>.
If only a single port or vulnerability is being probed on your network,
they are most likely using one of these "single mission" tools.  However,
there exist  tools that probe for a variety of vulnerabilities or
weaknesses, the two very popular tools are sscan by jsbach and 
<A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap">nmap</A> by Fyodor. 
We selected these two tools because they represent the two "categories"
of scanning tools.  We highly recommend you run these tools against
your own network, you may be surprised by  the results :)<br>
<b>NOTE:</b>.  The tool sscan is severely out of date.  sscan is 
discussed only as an example.  For scanning your own
network for vulnerabilities, we highly recommend the OpenSource tool
<a href="http://www.nessus.org">Nessus</a>.
<p>
sscan represents the "all purpose" Script Kiddie scanning tool.  It probes a network
for a set of specific vulnerabilities.  It is 
customizable, allowing you to add probes for new exploits.  You just
give the tool a network and network mask, and it does the rest for you. 
However, the user must be root to use it.  The output is extremely
easy to interpret (hence making it so popular):  It gives a concise
summary of many vulnerable services.  All you have to do is run sscan
against a network, grep for the word "VULN" in the output, and then run
the "exploit du jour".  Below is an example of sscan ran against the
system mozart </font>
(<FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>172.17.6.30</FONT></FONT>).

Nmap represents the "raw data" tool set.  It doesn't tell you what
vulnerabilities exist,  rather, it tells you what ports are open,
you determine the security impact.  Nmap has quickly become the port
scanner of choice, and with good reason.  It takes the best of a variety
of port scanners and puts all their functionality into a single tool, including
OS detection, various packet assembly options, both UDP and TCP scanning,
randomization, etc.  However, you need  networking skills to
use the tool and interpret the data.  Below is an example of nmap
ran against the same system.

<P>As you see above, a complete connection was made to determine the version
of wu-ftpd that was running.  When you see the complete connections
in your logs, as shown above, you are most likely  being scanned by
an exploit tool.  These tools are making a complete connection to
determine what you are running.

<P>Nmap, like most port scanners, does not care <B>what</B> you are running,
but <B>if</B> you are running specific services.  For this, nmap has
a powerful set of options, letting you determine what kind of connection
to make, including SYN, FIN, Xmas, Null, etc.  For a detailed description
of these options, check out <A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap_doc.html">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/nmap_doc.html. </A> 
Because of these options, your logs will be different based on the options
selected by the remote user.   A connection made with the -sT
flag is a complete connection, so the logs will like similar to sscan,
however by default nmap scans more ports.

One thing to keep in mind is the -D (or decoy) option.  This nmap
option allows the user to spoof the source address.  You may see scans
from 15 different sources at the same time, but only one of them is the
real one.  It is extremely difficult to determine which of the 15
was the actual source.  More often, users will select the -sS flag
for port scanning.  This is a stealthier option, as only a SYN packet
is sent.   If the remote system responds, the connection is immediately
torn down with a RST.

<p>
Dooh!  Notice there is nothing there!  That is because system logs
only record full connections.  Since nmap scanner is using -sS option,
a complete TCP connection is not being made, thus the scan attempts
are not being logged.  That is why this scanning method is considered
stealthy, system logs are not recording the scans.  
For older Linux kernels, specifically 2.0.x, incomplete TCP connections 
are being logged, but as broken.  The logs from a -sS scan looks as follows
for older kernels.  (<B>NOTE</B>: Only the first three entries are included here).

<P>
Notice all the errors in the connections.  Since the SYN-ACK sequence
is torn down before a complete connection can be made, the daemon cannot
determine the source system.  The logs show that you have been scanned,
unfortunately you do not know by whom.  This behaviour only happens with
older 2.0.x linux kerenls.  To qoute Fyodor " ... based on all
the 'connection reset by peer' messages.  This is a Linux 2.0.XX oddity
-- virtually every other system (including the 2.2 and later kernels)
will show nothing.  That bug (accept() returning before completion
of the 3-way handshake) was fixed."

<P>Nmap includes other stealth option, such as -sF, -sX, -sN where various
flags are used,  This is what the logs look like for these scans

<P>
Once again, notice something here, no logs!  Scary huh, you just got scanned
and didn't even know it.  All three types of scans determined the
same results without them being logged, similar to the -sS option.
To detect these stealth scans, you will need to use a different 
logging application such as <A HREF="http://www.kalug.lug.net/tcplogd/">tcplogd</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.via.ecp.fr/~hugo/ippl/">ippl</A>.   Most
firewalls will also detect and log all of these scans, such as IPFIlter,
SunScreen, or FireWall-1.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Did They Gain Access?</FONT></B>
<BR>Once you have determined that you were scanned, and what you were looking
for, the next big question is "Did they get in?".   Most of today's
remote exploits are based on buffer overflows (otherwise known as smashing
the stack).  Simply stated, a buffer overflow is when a program (usually
a daemon) receives more input then it expected, thus overwriting critical 
areas in memory.  Certain code is then executed, usually giving the
user root access.  For more info on buffer overflows, check Aleph1's
excellent paper <a href="http://www.segmentationfault.com/learnc/smashingthestack.txt">
Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit</a>.

<P>
You can normally identify buffer overflow attacks in the /var/log/messages
log file (or /var/adm/messages for other flavors of Unix) for attacks such
as mountd.  You will also see similar logs in maillog for such attacks
against imapd.  A buffer overflow attack would look like this.

When you see something like this in your log files, someone has attempted
to exploit your system.  It is difficult to determine if the exploit
was successful.  One way to do this is, following the exploit attempt,
see if there are any connections from the remote source to your system. 
If they successfully login from the remote system, they have access. 
Another clue is if you find the accounts "moof", "rewt", "crak0", or "w0rm"
added to your /etc/passwd file.  These accounts, uid 0, are added
by some of the more common exploit scripts.  Once a black-hat gains
access, normally the first thing they do is wipe your logs clean and trojan
your logging (syslogd), for more information, see 
<A HREF="../enemy3/index.html">Know
Your Enemy: III</A>.  From this point on, you will not receive any
logs from your system as everything has been compromised.  What you
do next is subject for another article :).   Until then, I recommend
you check out <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/nav/recovering.html">http://www.cert.org/nav/recovering.html</A>

<P>
To help in finding anomalies in log files, one can use a shell script to
scans logs for specific signatues. For more detailed information
on grepping and sorting log files, check out this posting by

<BR>Your system logs can tell you a great deal about the enemy.  However,
the first step is guaranteeing the integrity of your log files.  One
of the best ways to do that is use a remote log server that receives and
stores logs from all systems.  Once secured, you can then identify
patterns in your log files.  Based on these patterns and log entries,
you can determine what the black-hat is looking for, and potentially what
tools they are using.  Based on this knowledge, you can better secure
and protect your systems.
