[note from Saumil: Khawar Nehal is a guy's name, and a quick Google search
on him turned this up in one of the pages:

Subject: Research on ISP ?

What would you like to know ?

ISP as in Internet SERVICE Provider is an extremely large number of
SERVICES from trying to replacing broken coffeecup holders for customers
sitting in the 'dark' to setting up creating your own gateways=20
and routers so that your network stays up under DOS attacks.

Thank You.
