Review your system for the following symptoms, any one of which may 
indicate your system has been compromised by the individuals covered
in this paper.

The directory /dev/.. /sun2 exists
The directory /var/spool/.recent exists
Solaris installation has /bin/pico
You can login as root, with the password ABcDeFgHiJ
Any logs or user files containing the user account 're' or 'r'.

If your system is running the Solaris operating system,
you can compare the MD5 signature of the following binaries to 
Sun's online MD5 fingerprint database.

/bin/ls
/bin/login
/bin/find
/bin/ps
/sbin/netstat

If possible, use a trusted copy of 'ls' 'find' or 'ps' to
review your system, as the binaries may be trojaned.
If you find any one of these signatures, you have most
likely been compromised.  If you have been compromised,
you may want to consider reinstalling the operating system
and applying the latest patches.  For more information, see
