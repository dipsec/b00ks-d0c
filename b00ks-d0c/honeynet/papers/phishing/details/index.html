<p>This side note provides a more detailed overview of the two incidents discussed in the "Phishing Technique One - Phishing Through Compromised Web Servers" section of this whitepaper. One incident was catpured using a honeypot deployed by the  <a
	href="http://www-i4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/lufg/honeynet">German Honeynet
	Project</a>, and the other incident was captured by a honeypot deployed by the <a
	href="http://www.honeynet.org.uk/">UK Honeynet Project</a>.</p>

<a name="de"><h2>Setup and Timeline for German Honeynet Project Phishing Incident</h2></a>

<p>The honeynet deployed and analysed by the German Honeynet Project in the first incident formed part of a diploma thesis (<a
	href="http://www.magellan-net.de/honeynet/papers/thesis_sven_mueller.pdf">&quot;Planung
	und Realisierung eines Honeynet zur Analyse realer Angriffe aus dem
	Internet&quot;</a>) by a graduate student at <a
	href="http://www.magellan-net.de/">MAGELLAN Netzwerke GmbH</a> in Cologne,
Germany. The honeynet was a high interaction research honeynet deployed by the
German Honeynet Project during November 2004.  The honeynet topology is depicted below:</p>

</center>

<p>The honeynet deployed was a typical <a
	href="http://www.honeynet.org/papers/gen2/index.html">GenII honeynet</a> based
on the three basic principles defined by the Honeynet Project: <b><i>data
		capture</i>, <i>data control</i></b> and <b><i>data analysis</i></b>.</p>

<p><b><i>Data capture</i></b> was performed by recording all inbound and
outgoing network traffic for later analysis, using packet sniffing tools such as
<a href="http://www.ethereal.com/docs/man-pages/tethereal.1.html">tethereal</a>.
All network traffic to and from a RedHat Linux honeypot was mirrored via the
monitor port of a network switch and logged using the popular open source
Intrusion Detection System <a href="http://www.snort.org/">snort</a> running in
binary capture mode (as daily pcap files). To allow keystroke logging after a
successful system compromise, version 2.1.7 of the Honeynet Project&#8217;s <a
	href="http://honeynet.org/papers/sebek.pdf">Sebek</a> kernel module was
installed on the honeypot. The Redhat syslog daemon was also modified to output
syslog information to the serial port for capture by the honeynet gateway.</p>

<p>For <b><i>data control</i></b>, all network traffic from the Internet was
routed through a transparent bridging honeynet gateway running the FreeBSD
release 4.10 operating system that limited outgoing network connections from the
honeypot. Outgoing connections were identified by SYN packets, differentiated
and logged by TCP connection types (such as IRC-connections), and the number of
connections limited to 15 IRC-connections and 10 other TCP-connections with a 24
hour period. Connection limiting is designed to allow attackers to successfully
compromise the honeypot and download a limited amount of rootkits or other
malware from external servers, but to then limit their potential to attack
further hosts from the compromised honeypot. It also helps to hide the presence
of the honeynet gateway by not totally blocking all outbound traffic, along with
preventing denial of service attacks.</p>

<p>For <b><i>data analysis</i></b>, all network traffic to or from the honeypot
was mirrored to a snort IDS for pattern matching against the current signature
rulebase. Manual and automated analysis of logged data was performed regularly,
along with real time monitoring and alerting.</p>

<p>The honeynet gateway was connected to a central network switch which was used
to separate network traffic from the honeypot system network and the
administrative network using <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN">VLANs</a>, a common method to
logically segmented network on the same physical hardware.  The honeypot itself
was a standard installation of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> Linux
version 7.1 on Intel hardware running the latest version 2.4.20 kernel with
several network services such as FTP (wu-2.6.1-16), HTTP (Apache 1.3.19,
OpenSSL/0.9.6) and a database (MySQL 3.23.36) server enabled. All services were
left in their default configuration, except for the MySQL database which had a
random secure password set for the root user. To make the system more realistic
and more closely simulate a production system, a mocked up web site for an
imaginary sales company was installed and reverse DNS added for the web
server.</p>

<a name="uk"><h2>Setup and Timeline for UK Honeynet Project Phishing Incident</h2></a>

<p>The honeynet deployed and analysed by the UK Honeynet Project in the second phishing incident was a high interaction research honeynet deployed in a UK ISP data centre during August 2004.</p>

<center>
<img width=287 height=375 src="uk-honeynet_files/image001.jpg" border=0></p>
</center>

<p>The UK Honeynet deployment was similar in broad outline to the German honeynet configuration detailed above, being composed of a number of physical honeypots running default installations of common UNIX operating systems on Intel and Sparc hardware. The Honeynet Project&#8217;s <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/tools/cdrom">Honeywall</a> bootable CDROM was used for <b>data control</b>, providing a transparent bridging iptables firewall and using network connection rate limiting plus the snort-inline IPS to restrict outbound attack traffic.  Another snort IDS provided <b>data capture </b>in binary pcap format, along with snort and snort-inline alerting and automated daily script based <b>data analysis</b>.</p>

<p>Individual honeypots were hosted behind the Honeywall gateway, connected to
an Ethernet hub, and the Honeynet project's Sebek loadable kernel module was
covertly installed and enabled on each honeypot to allow full keystroke logging.
All network traffic to and from the honeypots was logged in pcap format, as were
any keystrokes recorded using Sebek. Any compromised hosts were eventually taken
off line and imaged for later forensic examination.</p>

<p>The RedHat Linux 7.3 server on Intel hardware honeypot that was compromised and used to host a phishing attack was a default CDROM based installation with a number of common network services such as Apache and samba enabled and left un-patched.</p>
