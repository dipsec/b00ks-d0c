adore-ng works on kernel 2.6!

2.6.0-test1 and 2.6.3 UP tested! SMP has not been tested.

You need the module-init-tools for the new insmod, rmmod etc,
the old ones don't work anymore.

To build a adore for 2.6, use the "Makefile.2.6.gen" makefile
after you customized the elite UID etc (or you did not,
I dont care at all).

The 2.6.0-test1 kernel has a different declaration for
the unix_dgram_recvmg() function than the 2.6.3 kernel. Thats
why you may get some warning on 2.6.0 builds. You can ignore them.

With the 2.6 kernel, a version magic is build into the kernel
module (which are now .ko files carrying more info than
the old .o files for 2.4) which is even checked at loading time.
So, if the kernel is build with a different compiler than the
one used for building the module, you get an error like:

adore: version magic '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.2' should be '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.3'

To circumvent this you can set an own version magic in the
adore-ng.mod.c file (makes sense to use '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.3'
in this case.)
