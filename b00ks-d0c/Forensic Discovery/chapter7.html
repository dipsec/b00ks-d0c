<h1>Chapter 7: Persistence of deleted file information</h1>

<h2>7.1 Introduction</h2>

<p> Computers delete files frequently. Sometimes this happens
on explicit request by a user. Often, information is deleted
implicitly when an application discards some temporary file for
its own internal use.  Examples of such implicit file deletion
activity are text editor temporary files, files with intermediate
results from program compilers, and files in web browser caches.
As you use a computer system you unwittingly leave behind a trail
of deleted information.  </p>

<p> Computer systems have a mind of their own, too, leaving their
own trail of deletion as a side effect of activity that happens in
the background.  Examples of background deletion activity are
temporary files in mail system queues or in printer queues. Such
files exist for only a few seconds or minutes.  If your machine
provides network services to other systems, information from other
systems that you aren't even aware of may hit your disk. Logfiles
are another example of background file creation and deletion
activity.  </p>

<p> With many computer systems, deleted file information remains
intact on the disk, in unallocated data blocks and in unallocated
file attribute blocks, until it is overwritten in the course of
other activity. This can result in unexpected disclosure of
information when a machine (or its disk) is retired and resold as
second-hand equipment.  For a study on how much information can be
found on second-hand disk drives after the owner thought they had
deleted all their files, see Garfinkel and Shelat [Garfinkel, 2003].
</p>

<p> In this chapter we study how deleted file information can escape
destruction intact for months or even years, and how deleted file
attribute information can provide insight into past system activity.
We examine several systems and discover how well past activity can
be preserved in unallocated disk space.  At the end of the chapter
we explain why deleted file information can be more persistent than
ordinary file information.  </p>

<p> Although our results are based on UNIX file systems, we expect
that they will be applicable to any modern file system that maintains
a low degree of file fragmentation.  </p>

<h2>7.2 Examples of deleted information persistence</h2>

<p> In 1996, Peter Gutmann presented a paper on the problem of data
destruction [Gutmann, 1996], and a follow-up paper [Gutmann, 2001].
Peter's concern is with the security of sensitive information such
as cryptographic keys and unencrypted data. The best encryption in
the world is no good when keys or unencrypted content can be
recovered.  </p>

<p> Destroying information turns out to be difficult.  Memory chips
can be read even after a machine is turned off.  Data on a magnetic
disk can be recovered even after it is overwritten multiple times.
</p>

<p> Although memory chips and magnetic disks are designed to store
digital information, the underlying technology is analog.  With
analog storage of digital information, the value of a bit is a
complex combination of past stored values.  Memory chips have
undocumented diagnostic modes that allow access to values smaller
than a bit.  With modified electronic circuitry, signals from disk
read heads can reveal older data as modulations on the analog
signal.  </p>

<p> Another way to examine disks is surface scanning.  Figure 7.1
gives a spectacular example of old magnetic patterns that persist
on the side of a disk track.  You can find other images of
semiconductors and of magnetic patterns on the Veeco web site
[VEECO].  </p>

<p>

<blockquote>

magnetic disk tracks. Reproduced with permission of VEECO. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> However, lots of deleted information can be recovered without
ever doing magnetic disk surface scans, even when that information
was deleted long ago.  We examined the disk from a machine that
began its life as a Windows PC, that had a second life as a Solaris
firewall, and that finally was converted into a Linux system. After
installing operating system over operating system, the deleted
Solaris and Windows files were still clearly present as the contents
of unallocated disk blocks.  For example, we found intact copies
of many deleted Solaris firewall configuration files.  They could
be sitting on the machine for many more years without ever being
overwritten.  </p>

<h2>7.3 Measuring the persistence of deleted file contents</h2>

<p> The above Windows PC example is unusual. We were able to estimate
the age of deleted information simply because the Windows files
were installed before Solaris, and because the Solaris files
were installed before Linux.  Although files often contain
clues about when information was created, the contents of a deleted
file rarely provide obvious clues about when that file was deleted.
</p>

<p> In order to find out how long deleted file content survives,
we ran a 20-week experiment on a few machines on our own networks.
We followed the history of each data block from day to day, from
the time it was deleted to the time it was overwritten.  Every
night an automated script examined each 1 kbyte disk block, and
recorded a hash of the disk block content as well as the disk
block's status:  allocated, unallocated, or overhead such as inode
(file attribute) or bitmap block.  </p>

<p> Figure 7.2 shows the distribution of surviving file content versus
time of deletion for a small server file system.  Despite significant
fluctuation, the trend is clear.  We found about 100 Mbytes of
content that was deleted less than a week ago, while about 10 Mbytes
was left over from content that was deleted 20 weeks ago. At the
time of the measurement, this machine handled about 1500 email
messages daily (about 10 Mbytes of data), and did limited amounts
of WWW, FTP and DNS service.  Logging by the mail system amounted
to about 1.5 Mbytes of data each day.  The file system of 8.0 GByte
was about 50% full, and most of the email content and logging was
automatically deleted after a short time.  </p>

<blockquote>

deletion for

negative times represent the past.  The data in the graph represent
one-third of all unallocated disk blocks in the file system.  The
machine, spike.porcupine.org, is Wietse's FreeBSD server.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> With this particular machine, half the deleted file content
was overwritten after about 35 days.  Table 7.1 summarizes the results
for a variety of file systems. There is some variation, but
differences less than a factor of two are not significant. The
lesson is that deleted data can stay around for weeks or more.
</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">

<tr><th>Machine</th><th>File system</th><th>Half-life</th></tr>

<tr><td>spike.porcupine.org</td><td>entire disk</td><td>35 days</td></tr>

<tr><td>flying.fish.com</td><td>/</td><td>17 days</td></tr>

<tr><td>www.porcupine.org</td><td>entire disk</td><td>12 days</td></tr>

</table>

spike.porcupine.org (Wietse's FreeBSD server), flying.fish.com
(Dan's Linux workstation) and www.porcupine.org (Wietse's FreeBSD
web/ftp server).  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> What the graph and the table do not show is how information
survives.  Does a deleted file slowly erode away, or does it stay
mostly intact until it is finally destroyed? With file systems that
suffer from fragmentation problems, we expect that a deleted file
is destroyed gradually, one fragment at a time.  With file systems
that avoid fragmentation we expect that a deleted file stays mostly
intact until it is destroyed, in a relatively short time.  We return
to this topic at the end of this chapter.  </p>

<h2>7.4 Measuring the persistence of deleted file MACtimes</h2>

<p> We recall from chapter 2, "Time machines", that MACtimes,
the time attributes of files, can give great insight into
past activity on a machine.  In this chapter we apply the same
technique to deleted file attribute information.  </p>

<p> Furthermore, we recall from chapter 3 that UNIX file systems
store file
attributes separately from file content, and from chapter 4 that
some MACtime information survives when a file is deleted: </p>

<ul>

<li> The last modification time attribute (mtime) does not change
(Linux) or is set to the time of deletion (BSD, Solaris).

<li> The last read access time attribute (atime) does not change.

<li> The last status change time attribute (ctime) is set to the
time of deletion.

<li> Some Linux file systems have a fourth time attribute (dtime)
that records when a file was deleted, but the attribute doesn't
add much value and therefore we will not discuss it further.

</ul>

<p> As we will see in the next sections, deleted file attribute
information can survive for months or even years, just like deleted
file content.  Sometimes the reasons for survival are rather subtle,
and involve a combination of dumb luck and the existence
of pockets of low activity in the file system.  Sometimes the
reasons for survival are not subtle and involve mainly the application
of brute force.  </p>

<h2>7.5 Brute force persistence of deleted file MACtimes </h2>

<p> In order to find out how robust deleted file attribute information
can be, we set up a disposable Linux machine and downloaded version
4 of the Linux rootkit source code, <tt>lrk4.tgz</tt>, from one of
many malware download sites.  The rootkit software installation
procedure installs a network password sniffer program and replaces
a dozen system programs by modified versions.  The rootkit installation
procedure uses stealth techniques to ensure that the modified
program files have the same MACtimes, file sizes, and file CRC
(cyclic redundancy checksum) values as the files being replaced.
See section 5.10, "Subversion with rootkit software", for more
information about rootkit software, </p>

<p> We compiled the rootkit software, ran the procedure that installs
the modified system utilities, and removed the rootkit source code,
just like an intruder would do.  Then we did just about the worst
possible thing imaginable. We downloaded the Coroner's Toolkit
source code distribution, unpacked the archive in the exact same
directory as where the "intruder" unpacked the rootkit archive,
compiled our toolkit and then ran the software
in order to collect "evidence". Note: in order to avoid the kind
of data destruction as described here, the authors recommend the
use of CD-ROM images with ready-to-run software. For an example,
see [FIRE, 2004; KNOPPIX, 2004a; Knoppix, 2004b].  </p>

<p> By using the Coroner's Toolkit in this manner we knowingly
destroyed large amounts of information. We overwrote data blocks
that belonged to deleted rootkit files, we overwrote file attribute
blocks (MACtimes!) that belonged to deleted rootkit files, and we
destroyed last file access time information for compiler-related
files. Kids, don't do this at home!  Even after all that destruction
the Coroner's Toolkit still found the attributes of 476 deleted
files and directories that existed during the rootkit incident.
</p>

<p> In figure 7.3, the ctime graph at the top shows the approximate
times that files were deleted.  Notice the large peak on the
right-hand side of the graph; this shows when the rootkit directory
was removed, along with the source code and the compiler output
files.  </p>

<p> The atime graph in the middle shows when deleted files were
accessed in order to compile the rootkit source code.  The large
atime peak on the left-hand side corresponds to rootkit files that
were unpacked but not used. This is an artifact of many UNIX file
systems: they set the atime of a file to the time when it is created.
</p>

<p> The mtime graph at the bottom shows the last time that file
content was modified before it was deleted. Only 165 of the 476
deleted file residuals had mtimes in the incident time window; the
data points correspond to files that were produced while compiling
the rootkit source code.  The remaining 311 deleted file residuals
had nearly identical last file modification times in the distant
past.  Presumably, that was the time when the rootkit source code
was packaged for distribution on some other machine.  </p>

<blockquote>

MACtimes after downloading, compiling and running

file was deleted; atime shows the last read operation before a file
was deleted; and mtime shows the last time the file content was
modified. See the text for a discussion of specific graph features.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p> The signal of surviving deleted file MACtimes was so strong
that it should be hard to miss for anyone who knows what to look
for, even days after the event. The reason for the strong signal
is that rootkit software suffers from bloat and feature creep just
like other software.  Linux rootkit version 4 has a rather large
total footprint of approximately 780 files and directories, including
the compiler output files that are produced when the software is
compiled.  The Coroner's Toolkit, on the other hand, has a footprint
of "only" 300 files.  The number is not large enough to wipe out
all the rootkit's deleted file MACtime information.  </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#f0f0f0"> <tr> <td>

<p> <strong>Side bar: Using MACtimes for malware detection</strong> </p>

<p> MACtimes of deleted or existing files can reveal that someone
may have brought specific malware into a system. Malware, like any
software, is usually distributed in the form of archives that
contain multiple files. The software that maintains archives
carefully preserves the last modification time stamps of the original
files, and carefully restores those time stamps upon extraction.
Even after the files are deleted, the malware's last modification
time stamps can persist in the unallocated file attribute blocks.
</p>

<p> The rootkit incident of the previous section has an especially
revealing signature (see figure 7.4).  Of the 311 deleted file last
modification times not in the incident time window, 296 were
identical to within 15 seconds.  Whether or not the time in the
time stamps is forged does not matter. A peak with hundreds of
deleted mtimes in this particular time interval should raise
suspicion.  </p>

<p> A MACtime malware signature analysis can be done in a short
time compared to the time one needs to examine all the blocks on
a disk.  For example, the Coroner's Toolkit <tt>ils</tt> (list
inodes) command can read all the 2 million file attribute blocks
within an 8 GByte FreeBSD file system in less than half a minute,
much less time than would be needed to examine gigabytes of data
blocks.  </p>

<h2>7.6 Long-term persistence of deleted file MACtimes </h2>

<p> Brute force persistence of deleted file MACtimes, as shown in
the previous sections, relies on massive file system activity in
a relatively
short time.  This produces a strong signal that stands out well
above the noise.  The signal survives even when the event is followed
by a significant file system activity.  </p>

<p> The brute force example does not tell us how long deleted file
information can survive. In order to explore that question we
analyzed the deleted file MACtimes of several machines.  We were
surprised to find deleted file MACtime information going back
an entire year or more, typically back to the time the file system
was created on the disk.  </p>

<p> Figure 7.5 shows deleted file MACtime attributes for a FreeBSD
server machine that spends most of its time doing routine work:
sending and receiving email, providing network services such as
DNS, FTP and WWW, and maintaining logfiles.  There is one exception
to the routine. The system owner is the author of an open source
mail server, and is the "first user" of every release.  "First use"
involves unpacking, compiling and removing the source code. At the
time of the measurement, releases happened roughly in monthly
bursts.  </p>

<blockquote>

<img src="figure7.5.gif">

<p> Figure 7.5: Time distribution of deleted file MACtime attributes
for a small server file system.  Time 0 corresponds to the present,
and negative times represent the past.  The machine, spike.porcupine.org,
is Wietse's FreeBSD server.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> On the right-hand side of the figure, deleted file MACtime
information decays gradually as one goes back in time.  On this
particular machine, 90% of the deleted file MACtime information is
overwritten in about 60 days, as the result of routine machine
activity. This corresponds with a half-life of about 20 days. This
is less than the 35 day half-life found earlier for deleted file
content, but the difference is not meaningful given the accuracy
of the measurements.  On the left-hand side of the figure, the
deleted file MACtime distributions are relatively sparse, but the
patterns go back until the time that FreeBSD was installed on the
machine.  </p>

<p> The top graph, with the distribution of the ctime attribute,
shows the approximate time since a file was deleted.  Any deleted
file ctime attributes that survive beyond the first 100 days of
history are likely to be the result of non-routine activity on the
machine.  For this particular machine, the most likely candidate
is the compiling and installing of new mail software on the machine,
and the subsequent removal of the source code.  </p>

<p> The atime graph in the middle shows the last time that a file
was accessed before it was deleted.  The atime information goes
back by hundreds of days just like the ctime (file deletion time)
graph.  This is not at all what one would find with ordinary file
MACtimes:  with ordinary files, atimes are the most volatile MACtime
component.  With deleted information the rules are different:
deleted file last access times are as persistent as any deleted
file attribute, because they are no longer updated.  </p>

<p> The bottom graph shows the distribution of the mtime (file
modification) attribute.  The FreeBSD file system sets the mtime
to the time of deletion, and therefore its graph is identical to
the ctime graph.  </p>

<h2>7.7 Impact of user activity on deleted file MACtimes</h2>

<p> Just like regular MACtimes, deleted file MACtimes are sensitive
to system usage patterns.  The data in the previous section are
typical for a dedicated machine that spends most of its time doing
routine work. The analysis of a personal workstation is more complex,
because system behavior is dominated by less predictable user
activity.  </p>

<p> Figure 7.6 shows deleted file MACtime patterns for a personal
workstation. This machine was the user's primary work environment
for sending and receiving email, for surfing the web, and for
developing software. In addition, it also did a limited amount of
routine WWW and DNS
service. The MACtime patterns for this machine are dramatically
different
from those for the dedicated server in figure 7.5.  </p>

<blockquote>

<img src="figure7.6.gif">

<p> Figure 7.6: Time distribution of deleted file MACtimes for a
personal workstation file system. Time 0 corresponds to the present,
and negative times represent the past.  The machine flying.fish.com
is Dan's RedHat Linux workstation.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> On the right-hand side, the deleted file ctime (time of deletion)
and atime (last read access) graphs show decay of recent history.
The decay is not nearly as smooth as in figure 7.5.  On the left-hand
side, the ctime and atime graphs show residuals from significant
activity in the more distant past.  As with the dedicated server,
the residuals go back in time until the file system was created.
</p>

<p> The workstation's deleted file mtime (last modification) graph
is unlike all the other graphs we have discussed.  The workstation's
distribution is actually made up from two components.  One component
correlates with the ctime and atime graphs, and corresponds to
relatively short-lived files; the other component shows up as a
more or less time-independent background of about 10 deleted file
residuals a
day.  </p>

<p>

<p> The existence of the time-independent component means that some
files have no correlation between the time of last update and the
time of deletion.  This is consistent with the primary user's
behavior.  According to the user, files accumulated over time at a
steady rate.  Every few months the user deleted a large number of
files to free up some space.  </p>

<h2>7.8 Trustworthiness of deleted file information</h2>

<p> Deleted file MACtimes or contents present the investigator with
great opportunities. Because deleted information is less visible
than ordinary information, an opponent is less likely to be aware
that the information exists, and therefore is less likely to tamper
with it.  For example, if a logfile was modified, it is possible
that portions of the unmodified file can still be recovered
from unallocated file system space.  </p>

<p> Deleted file MACtimes inherit only some of the limitations from
existing file MACtimes. Prior to deletion, a file is relatively
easy to access. Its MACtime information is volatile and is easily
forged, as described in chapter 2. After deletion, it is relatively
easy to non-selectively overwrite deleted file MACtimes by creating
a large number of small files.  Changing specific deleted attributes
becomes more difficult, at least on systems that can permanently
revoke write access to kernel memory or disk devices (see, for
example, section 5.6, "Protecting forensic information with kernel
security levels").  </p>

<p> A similar argument can be made for deleted file contents.
Prior to deletion, information is relatively easy to access, and
therefore relatively easy to modify.  After deletion, it is relatively
easy to non-selectively overwrite deleted file contents by creating
a small number of large files.  Changing specific deleted data
blocks becomes more difficult, at least on systems that can
permanently revoke write access to kernel memory or disk devices.
</p>

<p> After deletion, forging file MACtimes or contents can be risky.
The straight-forward approach is to bypass the file system and to
write to the raw disk.  There is a definite possibility of file
system corruption when a mala fide opponent competes with a bona
fide file system for access to the same file system block.  A more
reliable approach would involve a kernel module that
performs the cleansing while cooperating with the file system,
rather than competing against it. </p>

<p> Completeness is an obvious issue with deleted information.
Contrary to existing file MACtimes
or file contents,  deleted information can be overwritten at any
point in time, and therefore it is more likely to be incomplete.
As
discussed in chapter 1, the absence of specific information must
not be used as evidence that the information was never stored. With
unallocated storage this is even more true than with ordinary file
information.  </p>

<h2>7.9 Why deleted file information can survive intact</h2>

<p> In the previous sections we have shown that deleted information
can escape destruction for months or even years.  In this section
we'll illustrate how high-performance file system design can
influence long-term survival of deleted file information.  </p>

<p> High-performance file systems avoid disk head movements by
keeping related information closely together. This not only reduces
the fragmentation of individual file contents, it also reduces
delays while traversing directories in order to access a file.
Although the details given below are specific to popular UNIX
systems, we expect that similar persistence effects happen with
any file system that has good locality properties. </p>

<p> The typical UFS or Ext3fs file system is organized into
equal-sized zones (see figure 7.7).  These file systems descend from
the Berkeley Fast File System [McKusick, 1984] and are found on
Solaris,
FreeBSD and Linux [Card, 1994].  Typical zone sizes are 32768
blocks;
the actual block size depends on file system type, and with some
systems it also depends on the file system size.  New files are
created preferably in the same file system zone as their parent
directory; this improves the clustering of related information.
New directories are created in zones that have few directories and
lots of unused space.  </p>

<blockquote>

<img src="figure7.7.gif">

<p> Figure 7.7: On-disk layout of a typical UFS or Ext3fs file system.
Storage space is divided up into multiple zones. Each zone contains
its own allocation bitmaps, file data blocks, and file attribute
(inode) blocks.  Normally, information about a small file is stored
entirely within one zone. The figure is not drawn to scale.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> By keeping related information within the same file system
zone, typical UFS or Ext3fs file systems tend to cluster the files
from different users or applications according to different file
system zones.  Because of this, the survival time of deleted
information depends strongly on the amount of file write activity
within its zone. As shown in figure 7.8, write activity can be
highly focused within specific file system zones. </p>

<blockquote>

<img src="figure7.8.gif">

<p> Figure 7.8: Percentage of data blocks per file system zone that
were overwritten in one month time, for a small FreeBSD server with
an 8Gbyte file system
that was filled to 50% capacity. The figure shows that disk write
activity is focused within specific zones.  Less than 4% of all
data blocks were changed during this one-month time interval.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p> When a file is deleted in a high-activity zone, its data blocks
and inode (file attribute) information will be overwritten relatively
quickly by new files.  We saw an example of this in chapter 4, when
we failed to recover files that were deleted from the <tt>/tmp</tt>
directory.  </p>

<p> On the other hand, when a file is deleted in a low-activity zone,
its data blocks and inode (file attribute) information can escape
destruction as long as file system activity stays within other file
system zones.  As the disk fills up in the course of time, write
activity will unavoidably migrate into the quiet neighborhoods of
low-activity zones, turning them into destructive high-activity
zones.  Until that time, deleted file information in low-activity
zones can survive intact and in copious amounts.  </p>

<p> In chapter 1 we observed that computer systems tend to spend
most of their time running around in routine activity. In terms of
file system zones, this means that write activity tends to be
focused in a limited number of zones where information is created
and destroyed relatively quickly. The rest of the file system is
relatively static, and any file deleted there is likely to survive
for a relatively long time. </p>

<p> Thus, what we observed in chapters 1 and 2 for ordinary files
turns out to be true for deleted files as well: traces from routine
activity erode quickly, while unusual activity stands out because
its traces survive longer.  </p>

<h2>7.10 Conclusion</h2>

<p> This chapter shows that deleted file information can survive
intact for months or even years, and that deleted file attribute
information can give insights about past system activity that you
can't get from ordinary file attribute information.  </p>

<p> In chapter 1 we found that MACtime file access time patterns
of existing files can provide great insight into past system
behavior.  We also found that they suffer from a major drawback:
MACtime information is destroyed whenever a file is accessed in
one way or another.  Existing file MACtime information is volatile,
like footsteps in sand.  The next time you look it has changed.
</p>

<p> Deleted file MACtime information is different.  When a file is
deleted, its MACtime information does not change until it is
overwritten.  In other words, deleted file MACtime
information becomes frozen in time.  </p>

<p> The same is true for deleted file contents.  Once deleted, file
content does not change until it is overwritten. On
file systems with good clustering properties, deleted files can
remain intact for years.  Deleted file information is like a fossil.
A skeleton may be missing a bone here or there, but the fossil does
not change until it is destroyed.  </p>

<p> This phenomenon of deletion and persistence can happen at any
abstraction level.  At the abstraction level of file systems,
deleted information persists as unallocated disk blocks until it
is overwritten.  At the abstraction level of magnetic disk reading
heads, overwritten information persists as analog modulations on
the newer information.  And at the abstraction level of magnetic
domains, overwritten information persists as magnetic patterns on
the side of magnetic tracks, as shown in figure 7.1.  </p>

<p> At each layer in the hierarchy of abstractions that make up
computer systems, information becomes frozen when it is deleted.
Although deleted information becomes more and more ambiguous as we
descend to lower and lower levels of abstraction, we also find that
deleted information becomes more and more persistent.  Volatility
is an artifact of the abstractions that make computer systems
useful.  </p>

<p> All this has major consequences not only for intruders whose
activity is reconstructed with post-mortem intrusion analysis, but
also for the privacy of legitimate users of computer systems.  For
a discussion that covers much more than just computer systems, we
refer the reader to Michael Caloyannides's book on privacy versus
forensics [Caloyannides, 2004].  </p>
