<h1>Appendix A: The Coroner's Toolkit and related software </h1>

<h2>A.1 Introduction </h2>

<p> The Coroner's Toolkit is a collection of forensic utilities by
Wietse Venema and Dan Farmer [Farmer and Venema, 2004]. The software
was presented first in 1999, in a one-day forensic analysis class
at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. The first general release
was in 2000, via the author's websites. The software was extended
in various ways by Brian Carrier, who makes his version available
as the Sleuth Kit [Carrier, 2004a].  This appendix presents an
overview of TCT and of some of its extensions.  </p>

<h2>A.2 Data gathering with <tt>grave-robber</tt> </h2>

<p> The <tt>grave-robber</tt> command collects forensic
information. This tool can be used either on a "live" victim machine,
or on a disk image from a victim's file system.  In "live" collection
mode, <tt>grave-robber</tt> aims to respect the Order Of Volatility
(see Appendix B). It uses many of the utilities that are part of
TCT to collect information in the following order:

<ul>

<li> <p> The attributes of all the commands and files that TCT
accesses while it gathers information. These are collected first
in order to preserve their MACtime attributes. </p>

<li> <p> Process status information, and optionally, the memory of
all running processes. </p>

<li> <p> Deleted files that are still active. </p>

<li> <p> The executable files of all processes. </p>

<li> <p> All attributes from deleted files. </p>

<li> <p> Network status information. </p>

<li> <p> Host status information, via system dependent commands
that provide system configuration information. </p>

<li> <p> Attributes of existing files; this produces the <tt>body</tt>
file that is used by the <tt>mactime</tt> tool as described below. </p>

<li> <p> Optionally, security sensitive information that is under
control by users of the system, such as files that grant remote
access to a user's account, and <tt>cron</tt> jobs for unattended
command execution on behalf of users. </p>

<li> <p> Copies of configuration files and other critical files.
</p>

</ul>

<p> All this information is stored in a "vault", a protected
directory structure that is named after the host and the time of
the start of data collection. For each file that is stored into
the vault, <tt>grave-robber</tt> also computes the MD5 hash.  At the end,
as the vault is closed,  <tt>grave-robber</tt> computes the MD5 hash over
all individual file hashes. </p>

<p> By definition, <tt>grave-robber</tt> is exposed to information that
comes from the untrusted victim machine. It frequently uses this
information while executing TCT commands and system commands.
While doing so, it takes great care to never expose that untrusted
information to a shell command interpreter. For more of the
philosophical issues behind <tt>grave-robber</tt>, see Appendix B.  </p>

<h2>A.3 Time analysis with <tt>mactime</tt> </h2>

<p> The <tt>mactime</tt> command takes file attribute information
from a <tt>body</tt> file
that was produced by <tt>grave-robber</tt>, and produces a chronological
report of all file access methods by file name.  Alternatively,
<tt>mactime</tt> can generate a <tt>body</tt> file on the fly while
it scans a file
system. This tool was written several years before the authors
started work on the TCT, and was adapted to fit into the
<tt>grave-robber</tt>
framework.  <tt>mactime</tt> is introduced in chapter 2, "Time
machines", and a larger example can be found in chapter 4, "File
system analysis".  </p>

<p> As an example of the kind of insight that <tt>mactime</tt> can
give, listings A.1 and A.2 present different views of the same remote
login session. The first shows what the remote user sees, and the
second shows the corresponding MACtime report.  For educational
reasons the example uses a very old machine so that the MACtimes
are spread out over time. This allows us to see a clear separation
between the start-up of the telnet server and login software, the
access of system files while the user logs in, and the start-up of
the user's login shell process.  </p>

<h2>A.4 File reconstruction with <tt>lazarus</tt> </h2>

<p> As discussed in chapters 3 and 7, modern file systems minimize
file access times by keeping related information closely together.
Among other things, this reduces the fragmentation of individual
files.  The TCT program <tt>lazarus</tt> takes advantage of this property
when attempting to reconstitute the structure of deleted file
content.  </p>

<p> <tt>lazarus</tt> is a simple program whose goal is to give unstructured
data some form that is both viewable and manipulatable by users.
It relies on a few simple principles and heuristics: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> All popular file systems divide their storage space into
equal-sized blocks. Typical block sizes are 1024 bytes and 4096
bytes.  As long as <tt>lazarus</tt> uses an input block size that is consistent
with this, it will never miss an opportunity for dividing up a file
appropriately.  </p>

<li> <p> File systems like to avoid file fragmentation performance
reasons. In particular, UNIX file systems tend to be relatively
fragmentation free even after years of use. </p>

<li> <p> Files often have a distinct signature at the beginning.
The venerable UNIX <tt>file</tt> utility uses a database with
patterns to recognize files by the signature of their content.
<tt>lazarus</tt> uses this in addition to a built-in pattern matcher to
recognize file headers and to classify other file content.  </p>

<li> <p> If a disk block looks similar to the previous disk block,
then <tt>lazarus</tt> assumes that both blocks are part of the same file. </p>

</ul>

<p>

With these in mind <tt>lazarus</tt> implements a sort of primitive digital
X-ray device.  It creates a map of the disk that essentially makes
the drive transparent -- you can peer into the disk and see the
data by content type, but the highly useful filesystem abstraction
is lost.  Figure A.1 shows an example of the interface and a
once-deleted image file.  </p>

<blockquote>

<img src="figureA.1.gif">

<p> Figure A.1: <tt>lazarus</tt> uncovering a deleted image. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> In the map of a disk, <tt>lazarus</tt> uses simple text characters to
represent data chunks.  A capital letter is used for the first block
of a chunk, while lower case is used for its remainder.
For example, "C"'s represent C source code, "H"'s are hypertext,
"L"'s are log files, "M"'s mail, "U"'s uuencoded content, and
"."'s unrecognized binary data. </p>

<p> In order to keep the map manageable, <tt>lazarus</tt> compresses large
chunks using a logarithmic (base 2) scale.  This means a single
character is 1 block of data, the second character 2 blocks, the
third 4, etc.  This allows large files to be visually significant
but not overwhelming - with a 1024 byte block size, a megabyte file
would only take up ten times
the space of a single block file. </p>

<p> <tt>lazarus</tt> demonstrates that UNIX file systems like to keep related
information within the same file system zone. For example, figure
A.1 shows that email files (indicated with "Mmmm") tend to be
clustered together. The figure also shows that email with lots of
hypertext
or uuencoded content is likely to be mis-identified.  The clustering
of files and file activity has important consequences for the
persistence of deleted information, as we see in chapter 7,
"Persistence of Deleted File Information".  </p>

<p> Software such as <tt>lazarus</tt> presents a problem of non-trivial
scope.  While <tt>lazarus</tt> takes care to neutralize active content in
hypertext etc. by rendering it as plain text, it does no sanity
checks on other data such as images, and may trip up bugs in a very
large and complex web browser program.  </p>

<p> <tt>lazarus</tt> has not evolved since its initial release. People who
want to browse disks should consider using Brian Carrier's Autopsy
tool [Carrier, 2004b].  </p>

<h2>A.5 Low-level file system utilities </h2>

<p> The TCT comes with a number of utilities that bypass the file
system layer. This allows the software to access existing file as
well as deleted file information.  Instead of file names, these
programs use
the abstraction of inode numbers and bitmap allocation blocks, or
the even lower-level abstraction of disk block numbers. These
lower-level concepts are introduced in chapter 3, "File system
basics". </p>

<p> The TCT supports popular UNIX file systems such as UFS (BSD
and Solaris), and EXT2FS and EXT3FS (Linux). The Sleuth Kit also
adds support for non-UNIX file systems such as NTFS, FAT16 and
FAT32 (Microsoft Windows). </p>

<p> Utilities that are part of the original TCT distribution:</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <tt>ils </tt> Access file attributes by their inode number.
By default, this lists all unallocated file attributes. </p>

<li> <p> <tt>icat </tt> Access file content by their inode number.
This is used primarily to look up deleted file content. </p>

<li> <p> <tt>unrm </tt> Access disk blocks by their disk block
number. By default, this reads all unallocated file content, and
produces output that can be used by programs such as <tt>lazarus</tt>.  In
the Sleuth Kit distribution, <tt>unrm </tt> is renamed to <tt>dls</tt>.
</p>

</ul>

<p> The Sleuth Kit adds a number of other low-level utilities, such
as: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <tt>ffind </tt> Map an inode number to the directory
entry that references the inode.  </p>

<li> <p> <tt>fls</tt> List directory entries, including deleted
ones.  Section 4.14 shows an example of the use of this utility.
</p>

<li> <p> <tt>ifind</tt> Map a data block number to the inode that
references the data block. </p>

</ul>

<p> The success rate of low-level file system tools with deleted
file information
is highly dependent on the file system type, and even on the version
of the operating system software. Section 4.11, "what happens when
a file is deleted", discusses how much
information
is lost and what is preserved when a file is deleted. </p>

<h2>A.6 Low-level memory utilities </h2>

<p> The tools described in this section are more for exploratory
use than rock-solid analysis. The reason for this is that their
output contains little or no structural meta information, so that
it is suitable only for processing with tools that don't take
advantage of such information. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <tt>pcat</tt> Dump the memory of a running process.  This
program is used in section 2.6; other examples of its use can be
found on the book's website. </p>

<li> <p> <tt> memdump</tt> Dump system memory while disturbing it
as little as possible. The output should be sent across the network,
in order to avoid interaction with the content of the file system
cache.  This program is used for some of the measurements in Chapter
8.  </p>
